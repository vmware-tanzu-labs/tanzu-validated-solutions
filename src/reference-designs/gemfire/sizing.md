#  ​Cluster Sizing Considerations for Tanzu GemFire**

Sizing a Tanzu GemFire deployment involves both calculation and practical testing. While estimates can be made, experimentation is necessary to determine accurate values for key sizing parameters that work well in real-world scenarios. This process requires testing with representative data and workloads, starting with a small scale to understand how the system behaves. Testing is essential because memory overhead can vary significantly depending on the data and workload, making it difficult to calculate precisely. The overhead is influenced by many factors, including the Java runtime environment (JVM) and its memory management system.

## Resource Considerations**

Memory is the primary resource for storing data in Tanzu GemFire and should be the first factor considered when sizing your deployment. As memory requirements are met, horizontal scaling will also scale other resources, such as CPU, network, and disk. Once the memory requirements are determined and the cluster size is set, only minor adjustments may be needed to account for these other resources. While memory typically drives horizontal scaling, it’s important to also consider other hardware and software resources, such as file descriptors (for sockets) and threads (processes).

## Sizing Process**

To size a GemFire cluster effectively, follow these steps:

1. Domain Object Sizing: Estimate the size of your domain objects, then calculate total memory requirements based on the number of entries.

2. Estimating Total Memory and System Requirements: Use tools like the [sizing spreadsheet](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/dam/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/assets/vmware-tanzu/data-solutions/tanzu-gemfire/10-1/gf/attachments-system_sizing_worksheet.xlsx) to estimate memory needs and system resources, accounting for GemFire region overhead. This does not account for other overhead, but provides a starting point.

3. Vertical Sizing: Begin by configuring a three-node cluster and test the "building block" for a single node. This helps determine the appropriate node size and workload configuration.

4. Scale-Out Validation: Test and adjust the configuration to ensure the system scales linearly and performs well as you expand.

5. Projection to Full Scale: Use the results from scale-out testing to finalize the configuration for your desired capacity and service-level agreement (SLA).



## Sizing Quick Reference**

Here are some general recommendations to guide your capacity planning:

* Data Node Heap Size:

  * Up to 32GB: Smaller data volumes (a few hundred GB) with low latency requirements.

  * 64GB+: Larger data volumes (500GB or more).

* CPU Cores per Data Node:

  * 2 to 4 cores: Development and smaller heaps.

  * 6 to 8 cores: Production, performance testing, and larger heaps.

* Network Bandwidth:

  * 1GbE: Development.

  * High bandwidth (10GbE or more): Production and performance testing.

* Disk Storage:

  * DAS or SAN: Recommended for all environments.

  * NAS: Not recommended due to performance and resilience issues.
