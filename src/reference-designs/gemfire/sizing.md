# ​Cluster Sizing Considerations for Tanzu GemFire

Estimations provide a starting point, but experimentation is necessary to determine accurate sizing parameters for real-world workloads. Begin with small-scale tests using representative data to understand system behavior. Testing is essential because memory overhead can vary significantly depending on the data and workload, making precise calculations difficult. Overhead depends on factors such as the Java runtime environment (JVM) and its memory management system.

## Resource Considerations

Memory is the primary resource for storing data in Tanzu GemFire and should be the first consideration when sizing your deployment. Once memory requirements are met, adding nodes increases total CPU, network, and disk resources. Once the memory requirements are determined and the cluster size is set, only minor adjustments may be needed for these additional resources. While memory typically drives horizontal scaling, it’s important to also consider other hardware and software resources, such as file descriptors (for sockets) and threads (processes).

## Sizing Process

To size a GemFire cluster effectively, follow these steps:

1. Calculate Domain Object Size: Estimate the size of your domain objects, then calculate total memory requirements based on the number of entries.

2. Estimate Total Memory and System Requirements: Use tools like the
[sizing spreadsheet](../../../attachments/system_sizing_v1.xlsx) to estimate memory needs and system resources, accounting for GemFire region overhead. This does not account for other overhead, but provides a starting point.

3. Perform Vertical Sizing: Configure a three-node cluster and test the "building block" for a single node. This helps determine the appropriate node size and workload configuration.

4. Scale-Out Validation: Test and adjust the configuration to ensure the system scales linearly and performs well as you expand.

5. Finalize Full-Scale Configuration: Use the results from scale-out testing to finalize the configuration for your desired capacity and service-level agreement (SLA).


## Sizing Quick Reference

Here are some general recommendations to guide your capacity planning:

* Data Node Heap Size:

  * Up to 32GB: Smaller data volumes (a few hundred GB) with low latency requirements.

  * 64GB+: Larger data volumes (500GB or more).

* CPU Cores per Data Node:

  * 2 to 4 cores: Development and smaller heaps.

  * 6 to 8 cores: Production, performance testing, and larger heaps.

* Network Bandwidth:

  * 1GbE: Development.

  * High bandwidth (10GbE or more): Production and performance testing.

* Disk Storage:

  * DAS or SAN: Recommended for all environments.

  * NAS: Not recommended due to performance and resilience issues.
