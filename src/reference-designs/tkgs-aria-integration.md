#### vSphere with Tanzu Key Components:

- **Supervisor Cluster:** vSphere with Tanzu introduces the concept of a Supervisor Cluster, which is responsible for managing and orchestrating the Kubernetes infrastructure. The Supervisor Cluster provides the control plane for Tanzu Kubernetes clusters and manages the underlying resources, including compute, storage, and networking.
- **Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service:** vSphere with Tanzu includes Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service, which simplifies the deployment and lifecycle management of Tanzu Kubernetes clusters. It provides a consistent and standardized approach to creating and managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across the vSphere infrastructure.
- **vSphere Namespaces:** A vSphere Namespace is a tenancy boundary within vSphere with Tanzu. A vSphere Namespace allows for sharing vSphere resources (computer, networking, storage) and enforcing resource limits with the underlying objects such as Tanzu Kubernetes clusters. For each namespace, you configure role-based access control ( policies and permissions ), images library amd virtual machine classes.
- **Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster (Workload Cluster):** Tanzu Kubernetes clusters are Kubernetes workload clusters in which your application workloads run. These clusters can be attached to SaaS solutions such as Tanzu Mission Control, Tanzu Observability, and Tanzu Service Mesh, which are part of Tanzu for Kubernetes Operations.
- **VM Classes:** A VM class is a template that defines CPU, memory, and reservations for VMs. VM classes are used for VM deployment in a Supervisor Namespace. VM classes can be used by standalone VMs that run in a Supervisor Namespace and by VMs hosting a Tanzu Kubernetes cluster. vSphere with Tanzu offers several default VM classes. You can use them as is or you can create new VM classes. <br> 
VM classes in vSphere with Tanzu are broadly categorized into two groups.
  - guaranteed: The guaranteed class fully reserves its configured resources.
  - best-effort: The best-effort class allows resources to be overcommitted.
- **Storage Classes:** A StorageClass provides a way for administrators to describe the classes of storage they offer. Different classes can map to quality-of-service levels, to backup policies, or to arbitrary policies determined by the cluster administrators.
- **vSphere Pod:** A vSphere Pod is a VM with a small footprint that runs one or more Linux containers. Each vSphere Pod is sized precisely for the workload that it accommodates and has explicit resource reservations for that workload. It allocates the exact amount of storage, memory, and CPU resources required for the workload to run. vSphere Pods are only supported with Supervisor Clusters that are configured with NSX-T Data Center as the networking stack.

## Tanzu Integration with Aria

Below section provides detailed overview on Integrating:

- vSphere with Tanzu with Aria Automation Cloud Assembly
- Monitoring Tanzu Clusters with VMware Aria Operations
- Centralized Logging using VMware Aria Operations for Logs

### Tanzu with VMware Aria Automation

Starting from vSphere 7.x it contains significant enhancements that enable you to work with Kubernetes natively to manage both virtual machines and containers from one interface. Automation Assembler offers several options for configuring, managing and deploying Kubernetes virtual workloads. Automation Assembler enables users to leverage the vSphere with Tanzu Kubernetes capabilities embedded within vSphere. You can access vSphere with Tanzu Kubernetes functionality via a vCenter cloud account with a vSphere implementation that contains supervisor clusters.

#### Prerequisites

- You must have access to vSphere 7.x or later environment
- The target vSphere environment must have at-least one Supervisor Cluster

#### Cloud Admin Workflow

Below are the list of activities that must to be performed by an Cloud Administrator:

![Cloud Admin Workflow](./img/tkgs-aria-integration/tkgs-aria-4.png)

1. Create a **vCenter Cloud Account:**  
To provision a vSphere with Tanzu Kubernetes deployment with Automation Assembler, you must have access to vSphere 7.x or later environment. In VMware Aria Automation, vSphere is available as part of a vCenter cloud account. To ad a vCenter Cloud Account see Create a vCenter cloud account in VMware Aria Automation. <br>
**Note:** After adding the vSphere Cloud account, it is essential to check the status "Available for Kubernetes Deployment." A green check in this status indicates that the target vSphere environment has one or more supervisor clusters, making it capable of effectively handling Tanzu Kubernetes clusters and modern cloud-native applications

    ![Cloud account status](./img/tkgs-aria-integration/tkgs-aria-5.png)

    In addition to the standard privileges needed for a service account to add a vCenter Cloud in VMware Aria Automation, the service account must also possess permissions for the following:

    - vSphere Namespace
    - VM Classes
    - Storage Views <br>

    For a comprehensive list of the supplementary privileges required to achieve successful integration of Tanzu with Aria Automation, please refer to the "vSphere with Tanzu Identity and Access Management vSphere Namespaces Privileges" documentation.
1. Add **Kubernetes Resources:** <br>
Cloud administrators can add, view, and manage the configuration of deployed clusters and namespaces, in Automation Assembler. Users with cloud administrator privileges can view, add, and manage Kubernetes clusters and namespaces to which you are entitled access on the **Infrastructure** > **Resources** > **Kubernetes** page. <br>
This page contains tabs for Clusters, Namespaces, Supervisor Clusters and Supervisor Namespaces. For the purpose of this document we will be focusing on **Supervisor Clusters** and **Supervisor Namespaces**.
    - To Add Supervisor Clusters, navigate to: **Infrastructure** > **Resources** > **Kubernetes** > **Supervisor Clusters** > **Add Supervisor Cluster**
    - To Add/Create Supervisor Namespace, navigate to: **Infrastructure** > **Resources** > **Kubernetes** > **Supervisor Namespace**

    **Note:** <br>
    - Given the available options in Aria 8.12.2, it is not recommended to create a Supervisor Namespace directly from the Resources tab. <br>
    This is because this method does not offer the required capability to add one or more VM Classes to the Supervisor Namespace. Instead, it is advisable to employ Cloud Templates to set up the Supervisor Namespace. Refer **Appendix A** which provides a sample VMware Cloud Template that allows you to define the cluster class during the creation of the Supervisor Namespace, ensuring a more efficient and controlled deployment.
    - When creating a Kubernetes Resource backed by a Supervisor Namespace, it is highly advisable to specify limits for CPU, Memory, and Storage. Administrators possess the flexibility to incorporate one, multiple, or all available storage policies into this resource. These storage policies will be utilized while defining the Cluster Plans, which, in turn, determine the backend storage policies applied to Nodes and PVCs (Persistent Volume Claims).
    - Each Supervisor Namespace within the Kubernetes Resource in Aria is inherently linked to a particular Project. A user's access to the Project directly influences their ability to access the corresponding Supervisor Namespace through the "kubectl vsphere" plugin. To ensure the seamless functioning of this feature, it is vital that both your vCenter and VMware Aria Automation deployment employ the same Active Directory for user synchronization. This synchronization ensures proper authentication and access control for users across the integrated environments. <br> 
    Without the synchronization, while the provisioning of the Namespace will still operate, VMware Aria Automation Project users will not be automatically granted access to the namespace. <br> 
    
    For further clarity, the table below illustrates the mapping of user roles and their corresponding access levels. <br>
    |**User Group Role**|**Supervisor Namespace Access**| **Description**|
    | -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------|
    | Project Owner | Owner | This user group will be granted `Owner` access, providing them with full control over the Supervisor Namespace created within the project |
    | Project Member | Can Edit | This user group will be given `Edit` access to the Supervisor Namespace created within the project. |
    | Project Viewer | Can View | This user group will be granted `View Only` access, enabling them to observe and inspect the contents of the Supervisor Namespace created within the project without the ability to make changes or modifications. |
    | Project Supervisor | No Access | This user group have no access to the Supervisor Namespace created under the project. |

1. Create **Kubernetes Zone**: <br>
Kubernetes zones enable cloud administrators to define policy-based placement of Tanzu Kubernetes clusters and supervisor namespaces used in Automation Assembler deployments. An administrator can navigate to **Infrastructure** > **Configure** > **Kubernetes Zone** use this page to specify what Supervisor clusters are available for provisioning of Supervisor namespaces and what properties are acceptable. Tagging the kubernetes zones appropriately is key to make use of policy-based placements of Supervisor Namespaces and Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters.  A Kubernetes Zone may point to Supervisor Cluster and/or Supervisor Namespaces. <br> 
Add supervisor clusters to enable supervisor namespace provisioning via this zone. And/Or add supervisor namespaces to enable kubernetes cluster provisioning <br> 
A cloud administrator can assign priorities on multiple levels. <br>
    - Kubernetes zone priority within a project.
    - Resource priority within a Kubernetes zone.
    - Cluster priority within a Kubernetes zone. <br>
    
    The cloud administrator can also assign tags on multiple levels:
    - Capability tags per Kubernetes zone.
    - Tags per resource assignment.
    - Tags per cluster assignment

1. Add Kubernetes Zone to Project: After creating the Kubernetes Zones, administrators have the option to associate these Zones with a project. This association enables project users to independently provision necessary resources, such as Supervisor Namespaces and Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters. <br>
Additionally, administrators have the flexibility to set a limit on the maximum number of Supervisor Namespaces that can be created within the project. 

1. Create **Cluster Plans**:
You must create a cluster plan for use with vSphere with Tanzu Kubernetes deployments in VMware Aria Automation. A cluster plan functions as a configuration template for provisioning Tanzu Kubernetes cluster instances on a particular vSphere cloud account instance. Generally, the cluster plan encodes a meaningful set of configuration properties, such as virtual machine classes, storage classes, etc, that are used when provisioning Tanzu kubernetes clusters on a particular vSphere server cloud account. <br>
After a cluster plan is created for one or more vSphere instance, all eligible supervisor namespaces, that an administrator assigns to host a Tanzu Kubernetes cluster using a Kubernetes zone assignment, should be aligned with respect to the configuration defined in the cluster plan specification. For example, the storage policy specified in the cluster plan should be added as a storage class to all vSphere supervisor namespaces dedicated for provisioning of Tanzu clusters. <br>
**Note:** <br>
While creating a Cluster plan, you will be able to define:
    - Kubernetes Version
    - Size and number of Control Plane and Worker Nodes
    - Storage class for Control Plane and Worker Nodes
    - Default PVC (Based on the available storage policies defined in Kubernetes Zone)
    - Additional Storage Classes for PVCs (Based on the available storage policies defined in Kubernetes Zone)
    - Use Default or override default Network Settings. Override Network option provides you to define below properties:
        - Choose Default CNI: Antrea is the default CNI, you can override this to Calico
        - Customize POD and Service CIDR blocks
        - Provide HTTP and HTTPs proxy details
        - Add additional Certificates to the Cluster Trust store

1. Create **VMware Cloud Templates**: <br>
When adding Kubernetes components to an Automation Assembler cloud template, you can enable users to create supervisor namespaces and Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters in various configurations. Typically, this choice depends on your access control requirements, how you have configured your Kubernetes components, and your deployment requirements. 
    - **Template to create Supervisor Namespace:** These templates enables admins and users to create Supervisor Namespace on demand. The Supervisor namespace is always tied to a Project, based on the user access to the project, the respective user will be able to access the Supervisor names space using "kubectl vsphere" plugin. Refer "Appendix A" for a Sample Super Namespace Template <br> 
    **Note:** Both your vCenter and your VMware Aria Automation deployment should use the same Active Directory for users to be synched. Though provisioning will still function if this is not the case, VMware Aria Automation users will not get automatic access to the namespace. 
    - **Template to create Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster Creation:** These templates enables admins and users to create Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters. Depending on the template format, the users will be able to make choose the required cluster plan, # of Worker Nodes, Storage options and others. Refer `Appendix B` for a Sample Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster Template 

1. Publish and Release the Cloud Templates to Service Broker Catalog: <br>
Upon finalizing the Cloud Template and preparing to provide access to users, it is necessary to create a version of the Cloud Template and release it to the Service Broker catalog. By doing so, the Cloud Template becomes available through the Aria self-service portal, enabling users to request and provision the service specified in the Cloud Template. <br>
**Note:** In the event that the Content Source is not configured within the Service Broker, it becomes necessary to create one and integrate it with the project where you have created the Cloud Template. A Content Source in the Service Broker serves as a definition for a collection of Cloud Templates (along with other options), which can then be utilized as catalog items within the Service Broker


#### Developer/User Workflow

Below are the list of activities that the Developer/User can work on

- Provisioning and Accessing Supervisor Namespace
- Provisioning and Accessing Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters

![Developer/User Workflow](./img/tkgs-aria-integration/tkgs-aria-6.png)

##### Provisioning and Accessing Supervisor Namespace

Using the catalog service offered by the Service Broker, developers have the capability to create Supervisor Namespaces dynamically as needed. Each Supervisor Namespace is intrinsically linked to a particular Project, and user access to that Project determines their privileges to access the corresponding Supervisor Namespace via the kubectl vsphere plugin. The table below illustrates the mapping of user roles:

|**User Group Role**|**Supervisor Namespace Access**| **Description**|
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------|
| Project Owner | Owner | This user group will be granted `Owner` access, providing them with full control over the Supervisor Namespace created within the project |
| Project Member | Can Edit | This user group will be given `Edit` access to the Supervisor Namespace created within the project. |
| Project Viewer | Can View | This user group will be granted `View Only` access, enabling them to observe and inspect the contents of the Supervisor Namespace created within the project without the ability to make changes or modifications. |
| Project Supervisor | No Access | This user group have no access to the Supervisor Namespace created under the project. |

**Note:** To ensure this functionality works as expected, it is crucial that both your vCenter and VMware Aria Automation deployment utilize the same Active Directory for user synchronization. <br>

Below is a snippet of users who possess access to the Project:

![User-access to project](./img/tkgs-aria-integration/tkgs-aria-7.png)

Once a Supervisor Namespace is created and associated with the project, the following snippet illustrates the user privileges on the Supervisor Namespace (as viewed in vCenter):

![User privileges](./img/tkgs-aria-integration/tkgs-aria-8.png)

Upon successful creation of a Supervisor Namespace, users can acquire the `kubectl vsphere` plugin binaries and access details for the Supervisor Namespace from the deployment topology accessible within the Service Broker.

![Access supervisor namespace](./img/tkgs-aria-integration/tkgs-aria-9.png)

By obtaining direct access to the Supervisor Namespace, developers can carry out the following actions:

- **Deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters:** This allows administrators and developers to easily create and manage Kubernetes clusters, providing a robust and scalable platform for container orchestration and modern application deployment practices.

- **Deploy vSphere Pods:** Developers can deploy vSphere Pods to run applications in the vSphere infrastructure, enabling efficient utilization of resources and isolation.

- **Install required Tanzu Packages on the Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters:** Developers can install essential Tanzu Packages on the Kubernetes clusters to enable additional functionalities and features.

- **Perform Day 2 operations, such as Upgrades and Scaling (out or up):** This includes actions like upgrading Kubernetes versions or scaling the cluster nodes to accommodate increased workloads.

- **Deploy and access Applications:** With direct access to the Supervisor Namespace, developers can seamlessly deploy and access applications

For further information regarding the aforementioned activities, please refer to the vSphere with Tanzu product documentation.


##### Provisioning and Accessing Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters

#### Workload Management Inventory Objects

VMware Aria Operations discovers the following workload management objects and their child objects using the vCenter adapter:

- Tanzu Kubernetes cluster
- vSphere Pods
- Supervisor Namespace

In the VMware Aria Operations inventory, the summary tab of the Supervisor Cluster indicates that it has workload management activated. The Supervisor Cluster contains specific objects that activate the capability to run Kubernetes workloads within ESXi. VMware Aria Operations collects metrics and data for the Supervisor Cluster. 

- Namespaces contain virtual machines with k8s activated. They are called k8s control VMs. These VMs are managed by vSphere. Therefore, you cannot take action on these VMs from within VMware Aria Operations.
- DevOps engineers can run workloads on containers running inside vSphere Pods. They can create Tanzu Kubernetes cluster inside a Supervisor Namespace.
  - A vSphere Pod is a VM with a small footprint that runs one or more Linux containers. It is the equivalent of a Kubernetes pod.
  - A Tanzu Kubernetes cluster is a full distribution of the open-source Kubernetes container orchestration software that is packaged, signed, and supported by VMware.
- Workload management objects are excluded from the following workflows:
  - Compliance
  - Reclaim
  - Right sizing
  - Workload optimization

##### Workload Management Dashboard

VMware Aria Operations includes a broad set of simple to use, but customizable dashboards to get you started with monitoring your VMware environment. The predefined dashboards address several key questions including how you can troubleshoot your VMs, the workload distribution of your hosts, clusters, and datastores, the capacity of your data center, and information about the VMs. You can also view log details. 

For the purpose of this document we will be focusing on below dashboards:

- *Workload Management Inventory Dashboard:* <br>
The Workload Management Inventory dashboards curates the Kubernetes inventory across all the Workload Management activated vSphere environments and displays it here. This includes an end to end topology map showcasing the health of all the objectes along with upstream and downstream dependencies. Upon clicking any object in the relationship tree, the related inventorty of Supervisor Clusters, Namespaces, Pods, Developer Managed VMs and Tanzu Kubernetes clusters can be viewed and exported from this dashboard. You can use the dashboard widgets in several ways.
<br>
  - Environment Summary: Provides a summary of the supervisor cluster and the child objects.
  - Relationships: An interactive canvas where you can view the relationship between the different objects in the workload management inventory.
  - Properties: View the properties related to the object in the environment.
