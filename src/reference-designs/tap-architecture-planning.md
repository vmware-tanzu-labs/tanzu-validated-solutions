# VMware Tanzu Application Platform Architecture

The VMware Tanzu Application Platform architecture provides a path to creating a production deployment of Tanzu Application Platform (informally known as TAP) 1.6. However, do not feel constrained to follow this exact path if your specific use cases warrant a different architecture.

Design decisions enumerated in this document exemplify the main design issues you will encounter in planning your Tanzu Application Platform environment and the rationale behind a chosen solution path. Understanding these decisions can help provide a rationale for any necessary deviation from this architecture.

![Tanzu Application Platform reference architecture](img/tap-architecture-planning/overview.jpg)


## Cluster Layout

For production deployments, VMware recommends two fully independent instances of Tanzu Application Platform. One instance for operators to conduct their own reliability tests, and the other instance hosts development, test, QA, and production environments isolated by separate clusters.

| Decision ID   | Design Decision   | Justification | Implication
|---            |---                |---            |---
|TAP-001  | Install using multiple clusters.         |  Utilizing multiple clusters allows you to separate your workloads and environments while still leveraging combined build infrastructure.   |  Multiple cluster design requires more installation effort and possibly more maintenance versus a single cluster design.
|TAP-002  | Create an operator sandbox environment.  |  An operator sandbox environment allows platform operators to test upgrades and architectural changes before introducing them to production. |  An operator sandbox requires additional computer resources.
|TAP-003  | Utilize a single Build Cluster and multiple Run Clusters  | Utilizing a single Build Cluster with multiple Run Clusters creates the correct production environment for the build system vs separating into dev/test/qa/prod build systems. Additionally, a single Build Cluster ensures that the container image does not change between environments.  A single Build Cluster is also easier to manage than separate components. |  *Changes lower environments are not as separated as having separate build environments.*
|TAP-004  | Utilize a View Cluster  | Utilizing a single View Cluster with multiple Run Clusters creates the correct production perception for the common systems like learning portal, GUI, app resource monitoring, etc. |  None

## Build Cluster Requirements

The Build Cluster is responsible for taking a developer's source code commits and applying a supply chain that will produce a container image and Kubernetes manifests for deploying on a Run Cluster.

The Kubernetes Build Cluster will see bursty workloads as each build or series of builds kicks off. The Build Cluster will see very high pod scheduling loads as these events happen. The amount of resources assigned to the Build Cluster will directly correlate to how quickly parallel builds are able to be completed.

### Kubernetes Requirements - Build Cluster

* Supported Kubernetes versions are 1.25,1.26,1.27.
* Default storage class.
* At least 16 GB available memory that is allocatable across clusters, with at least 8 GB per node.
* 12 vCPUs available across all nodes.
* 100 GB of disk space available per node.
* Logging is enabled and targets the desired application logging platform.
* Monitoring is enabled and targets the desired application observability platform.
* Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver is installed.


### Recommendations - Build Cluster

* Spread across three availability zones (AZs) for high availability.


The Build Cluster includes the following packages (exact list may differ based on the supply chain choice):
```

 ```

## Run Cluster Requirements

The Run Cluster reads the container image and Kubernetes resources created by the Build Cluster and runs them as defined in the `Deliverable` object for each application.

The Run Cluster's requirements are driven primarily by the applications that it will run.  Horizontal and vertical scale is determined based on the type of applications that will be scheduled.

## Iterate Cluster Requirements

The Iterate Cluster is for "inner loop" development iteration. Developers connect to the Iterate Cluster via their IDE to rapidly iterate on new software features. The Iterate Cluster operates distinctly from the outer loop infrastructure. Each developer should be given their own namespace within the Iterate Cluster during their platform onboarding.

## Tanzu Application Platform Upgrade Approach

When a new version of Tanzu Application Platform is released, we recommend that you first upgrade the operator sandbox environment.

Before upgrading the production environment, install a sample subset of applications and perform any applicable platform tests specific to your organization in the sandbox. Such tests may include building a representative set of applications and verifying that they still deploy successfully to your sandbox Run Cluster.

The following upgrade sequence is recommended:

* Sandbox
  * View
  * Build
  * Run  
* Production
  * Iterate
  * View
  * Build
  * Run (dev)
  * Run (test)
  * Run (QA)
  * Run (prod)

|---            |---                |---            |---
|TAP-006  | Follow the upgrade order specified.         |  Upgrading in order promotes confidence in that software, configuration, and architecture is stable and reliable.   |  None

## Tanzu Application Platform Networking

To learn more about the most common cross-cluster and external-services networking scenarios in a multi-cluster Tanzu Application Platform Kubernetes environment, see [Tanzu Application Platform Networking](tap-networking.md).

## Services Architecture

The primary ways to consume services are In-Cluster, External Cluster, and External Injected. Services are consumed by applications via the 'workload.yaml'. The request is presented to the system as a ServiceClaim. The preferred method of service integration is the external cluster.

External Cluster provides services operations with their specific life cycle and performance requirements and separates the stateless and stateful workloads.

| Decision ID   | Design Decision   | Justification | Implication
|---            |---                |---            |---
|TAP-007  | Use external services and service clusters.         |  Utilizing external services allows the service operators to customize their cluster parameters for their specific services and manage their respective life cycles independently.   | Utilizing external clusters adds some technical complexity.

### In-Cluster

Services can be deployed directly into the same cluster running Tanzu Application Platform. This kind of deployment is more suited to iterate and run cluster environments using `crossplane` package. Possible implementations include:

  - same namespace
  - different namespaces

The following diagram shows the In-Cluster services with different namespaces.

![In-Cluster services with different namespaces](img/tap-architecture-planning/in-cluster.jpg)
<!-- slides 80-82 https://onevmw-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/mijames_vmware_com/EYK5tKWk83RFia7QHHkaAj0BUnnhenCjlto4qpYDY_ZyFw?e=NhmLnZ -->

### External Cluster

External clusters allow services to have different infrastructure, security, and scaling requirements. External services clusters are the recommended way to provide rapid service provisioning to platform users.

![External services clusters](img/tap-architecture-planning/external-cluster.jpg)

### External Injected

Applications that consume services that do not adhere to the Kubernetes service binding specification require the usage of a K8s secret, implemented in the same app deployment containing the necessary connection details. This method provides the most flexibility and makes it possible to consume legacy services.

![External injected applications](img/tap-architecture-planning/external-injected.jpg)

## Monitoring

The following metrics should be observed. If the values exceed service level objectives, the clusters should be scaled or other actions taken.

### Build Cluster

* Number of pods waiting to be scheduled
* Number of builds completed in the last 60 minutes
* Maximum number of seconds that any pod has waited for scheduling

### Run Cluster

* Number of pods waiting to be scheduled
* Maximum number of seconds that any pod has waited for scheduling
* Remaining allottable memory and CPU

### View Components

* Response time
* Runtime resource monitoring
* Availability

|---            |---                |---            |---
|TAP-008  | Monitor platform KPIs and setup alerts.         |  An external monitoring platform will keep metrics for the duration of their retention window. Further alerts will allow rapid response to issues before they impact developers and users.   | None

## Logging

Logging for Tanzu Application Platform is handled by the upstream Kubernetes integration for both applications and internal system components. An external logging platform should be used for storing and searching those logs.  For logging integration, see the reference architecture of your platform or logging platform.

| Decision ID   | Design Decision   | Justification | Implication
|---            |---                |---            |---
|TAP-009  |Use an external logging platform.          |  An external logging platform will keep logs for the duration of their retention window and offer superior searching capabilities.  | None

## Authentication

There are multiple ways to set up authentication in a Tanzu Application Platform deployment. You can manage authentication at the infrastructure level with your Kubernetes provider. VMware recommends Pinniped for integrating your identity provider into Tanzu Application Platform.

To use Pinniped, see [Installing Pinniped on Tanzu Application Platform](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.6/tap/authn-authz-pinniped-install-guide.html) and [Login using Pinniped](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.6/tap/authn-authz-pinniped-login.html).

|TAP-010 |Install Pinniped Supervisor into View Cluster. | View Cluster is the place to host all common components of Tanzu Application Platform. | None

## Authorization

Tanzu Application Platform supports RBAC (role-based access control) authorization. It provide six default roles to set up permissions for users and service accounts within a namespace on a cluster that runs one of the Tanzu Application Platform profiles. Following are the default roles.

The following four roles are for users:
 * `app-editor`
 * `app-viewertekton`
 * `app-operator`
 * `service-operator`

The following two roles are for service accounts associated with the Tanzu Supply Chain:
* `workload`
* `deliverable`

For more information, see [Tanzu Application Platform authorization](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.6/tap/authn-authz-overview.html).

## Developer tools (Inner-Loop)

Tanzu Application Platform allows developers to quickly build and test applications and provide many in-built developer friendly platform capabilities. To learn more about these capabilities, see [Tanzu Application Platform Developer Components](tap-architecture-dev-components.md).

## Deployment Instructions

For more information about deploying this reference design, see [Deploy multi-cluster Tanzu Application Platform profiles](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.6/tap/multicluster-installing-multicluster.html).
