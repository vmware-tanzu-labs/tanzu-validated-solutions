# Tanzu Kubernetes Grid on vSphere with NSX-T Networking in Air-Gapped Environment Reference Design

VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (multi-cloud) provides organizations with a consistent, upstream-compatible, regional Kubernetes substrate that is ready for end-user workloads and ecosystem integrations.

An air-gapped environment is a network security measure employed to ensure a computer or computer network is secure by physically isolating it from unsecured networks, such as the public Internet or an unsecured local area network. This means a computer or network is disconnected from all other systems.

This document lays out a reference design for deploying Tanzu Kubernetes Grid on NSX-T Data Center Networking in an air-gapped environment and offers a high-level overview of the different components required for setting up a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid environment. 

## Components

The following components are used in the reference architecture:

- **Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG)** - Enables creation and lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters.

- **NSX Advanced Load Balancer Enterprise Edition** - Provides layer 4 service type load balancer and layer 7 ingress support. NSX Advanced Load Balancer is recommended for vSphere deployments without NSX-T, or which have unique scale requirements.

- **Tanzu User-Managed Packages:** User-managed packages are distributed through package repositories. The `tanzu-standard` package repository includes the following user-managed packages:
  - [**Cert Manager**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-packages-cert-manager.html) - Provides automated certificate management. It runs by default in management clusters.

  - [**Contour**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-packages-ingress-contour.html) -Provides layer 7 ingress control to deployed HTTP(S) applications. Tanzu Kubernetes Grid includes signed binaries for Contour. Deploying Contour is a prerequisite for deploying the Prometheus, Grafana, and Harbor extensions.

  - [**Fluent Bit**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-packages-logging-fluentbit.html) - Collects data and logs from different sources, unifies them, and sends them to multiple destinations. Tanzu Kubernetes Grid includes signed binaries for Fluent Bit.

  - [**Prometheus**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-packages-monitoring.html) - Provides out-of-the-box health monitoring of Kubernetes clusters. The Tanzu Kubernetes Grid implementation of Prometheus includes an Alert Manager. You can configure Alert Manager to notify you when certain events occur.

  - [**Grafana**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-packages-monitoring.html) - Provides monitoring dashboards for displaying key health metrics of Kubernetes clusters. Tanzu Kubernetes Grid includes an implementation of Grafana.

  - [**Harbor Image Registry**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-packages-harbor-registry.html) - Provides a centralized location to push, pull, store, and scan container images used in Kubernetes workloads. It supports storing artifacts and includes enterprise-grade features such as RBAC, retention policies, automated garbage clean up, and Docker hub proxying.

  - [**Multus CNI**](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni) - Enables attaching multiple network interfaces to pods. Multus CNI is a container network interface (CNI) plugin for Kubernetes that lets you attach multiple network interfaces to a single pod and associate each interface with a different address range.

- **Bastion Host -** Bastion host is the physical/virtual machine where you download the required installation images/binaries (for TKG installation) from the Internet. This machine needs to be outside the air-gapped environment. The downloaded items then need to be shipped to the bootstrap machine which is inside the air-gapped environment.

- **Jumpbox/Bootstrap Machine -** The bootstrap machine is the machine on which you run the Tanzu CLI and other utilities such as [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/), [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), etc. This is where the initial bootstrapping of a management cluster occurs before it is pushed to the platform where it will run. 

The installation binaries for TKG installation are made available in iso/tarball format on this machine. This machine should have access to the infrastructure components such as the vCenter server and the components that will be deployed during the installation of Tanzu Kubernetes Grid. This machine should have a browser installed to access the UI of the components described above.

- **Local Image Registry -** An image registry provides a location for pushing, pulling, storing, and scanning container images used in the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid environment. The image registry is also used for day-2 operations of the Tanzu Kubernetes clusters. Typical day-2 operations include tasks such as storing application images, upgrading Tanzu Kubernetes clusters, etc.

In an air-gapped environment, there are a couple of possible solutions for using an image registry:

- **Existing Image Registry -** An image registry pre-existing in the environment with a project created for storing Tanzu Kubernetes Grid binaries and the bootstrap machine has access to this registry. The operator will untar the TAR file present in the bootstrap machine and push the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid binaries to the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid project using the script present in the TAR file. This registry can be a [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) registry or any other container registry solution.

- **New Image Registry -** If an image registry solution doesn’t exist in the environment, a new registry instance can be deployed. The easiest way for creating a new image registry instance is installing Harbor using the `docker-compose` method and then pushing the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid binaries to the project.

## Supported Component Matrix

## Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Components

VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) provides organizations with a consistent, upstream-compatible, regional Kubernetes substrate that is ready for end-user workloads and ecosystem integrations. You can deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid across software-defined datacenters (SDDC) and public cloud environments, including vSphere, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon EC2.

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid comprises the following components:

**Management Cluster -** A management cluster is the first element that you deploy when you create a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid instance. The management cluster is a Kubernetes cluster that performs the role of the primary management and operational center for the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid instance. The management cluster is purpose-built for operating the platform and managing the lifecycle of Tanzu Kubernetes clusters.

**Cluster API -** Tanzu Kubernetes Grid functions through the creation of a management Kubernetes cluster that houses [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/). Cluster API then interacts with the infrastructure provider to service workload Kubernetes cluster lifecycle requests.

**Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster -** Tanzu Kubernetes clusters are the Kubernetes clusters in which your application workloads run. These clusters are also referred to as workload clusters. Tanzu Kubernetes clusters can run different versions of Kubernetes, depending on the needs of the applications they run.

**Shared Services Cluster -**  Each Tanzu Kubernetes Grid instance can only have one shared services cluster. You will deploy this cluster only if you intend to deploy shared services such as Contour and Harbor.

**Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster Plans -** A cluster plan is a blueprint that describes the configuration with which to deploy a Tanzu Kubernetes cluster. It provides a set of configurable values that describe settings like the number of control plane machines, worker machines, VM types, and so on.

This current release of Tanzu Kubernetes Grid provides two default templates, dev, and prod. You can create and use custom plans to meet your requirements.

**Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Instance -** A Tanzu Kubernetes Grid instance is the full deployment of Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, including the management cluster, the workload clusters, and the shared services cluster that you configure.

**Tanzu CLI -** A command-line utility that provides the necessary commands to build and operate Tanzu management and Tanzu Kubernetes clusters.

**Bootstrap Machine -** The bootstrap machine is the laptop, host, or server on which you download and run the Tanzu CLI. This is where the initial bootstrapping of a management cluster occurs before it is pushed to the platform where it will run. This machine also houses a Harbor instance where all the required Tanzu Kubernetes Grid installation binaries are pushed.

**Carvel Tools -** An open-source suite of tools. Carvel provides a set of reliable, single-purpose, composable tools that aid in your application building, configuration, and deployment to Kubernetes. Tanzu Kubernetes Grid uses the following tools from the Carvel open-source project:

- **ytt -** A command-line tool for templating and patching YAML files. You can also use `ytt` to collect fragments and piles of YAML into modular chunks for reuse.
- **kapp -** The application deployment CLI for Kubernetes. It allows you to install, upgrade, and delete multiple Kubernetes resources as one application.
- **kbld -** An image-building and resolution tool.
- **imgpkg -** A tool that enables Kubernetes to store configurations and the associated container images as OCI images, and to transfer these images.
- **yq -** a lightweight and portable command-line YAML, JSON, and XML processor. `yq` uses `jq`-like syntax but works with YAML files as well as JSON and XML.

**Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Installer -** The Tanzu Kubernetes Grid installer is a CLI/graphical wizard that provides an option to deploy a management cluster. You launch locally on the bootstrap machine by running the `tanzu management-cluster create` command. 

## Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Storage

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid integrates with shared datastores available in the vSphere infrastructure. The following types of shared datastores are supported:

- vSAN
- VMFS
- NFS
- vVols

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid uses storage policies to integrate with shared datastores. The policies represent datastores and manage the storage placement of such objects as control plane VMs, container images, and persistent storage volumes.

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Cluster Plans can be defined by operators to use a certain vSphere Datastore when creating new workload clusters. All developers would then have the ability to provision container-backed persistent volumes from that underlying datastore.

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid is agnostic about which option you choose. For Kubernetes stateful workloads, Tanzu Kubernetes Grid installs the [vSphere Container Storage interface (vSphere CSI)](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) to automatically provision Kubernetes persistent volumes for pods.

[VMware vSAN](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSAN/index.html) is a recommended storage solution for deploying Tanzu Kubernetes Grid clusters on vSphere. 

|**Decision ID**|**Design Decision**|**Design Justification**|**Design Implications**|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|TKO-STG-001|Use vSAN storage for TKO|By using vSAN as the shared storage solution, you can take advantage of local storage, which is more cost-effective.|Adds additional cost as you have to procure vSAN license before you can use. |
|TKO-STG-002|Use vSAN storage for TKO|vSAN supports NFS volumes in ReadWriteMany access modes.|vSAN File Services need to be configured to leverage this.|

**Note:** vSAN File Service is available only in vSAN Enterprise and Enterprise Plus editions.

While the default vSAN storage policy can be used, administrators should evaluate the needs of their applications and craft a specific [vSphere Storage Policy](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.storage.doc/GUID-89091D59-D844-46B2-94C2-35A3961D23E7.html). vSAN storage policies describe classes of storage (e.g. SSD, NVME, etc.) along with quotas for your clusters. For more information on this, see [vSAN Policy Design](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Validated-Design/6.2/sddc-architecture-and-design-for-the-management-domain/GUID-450DFB03-1882-4A2A-B09F-2C7627095FD3.html#vsan-policy-design-3)

![vSAN storage policy for TKG](img/tkg-nsxt-airgap/tkg-nsxt-airgap01.png)

## Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters Networking

A Tanzu Kubernetes cluster provisioned by the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid supports two Container Network Interface (CNI) options:

- [Antrea](https://antrea.io/)
- [Calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/)

Both are open-source software that provide networking for cluster pods, services, and ingress.

When you deploy a Tanzu Kubernetes cluster using Tanzu CLI, Antrea CNI is automatically enabled in the cluster.

To provision a Tanzu Kubernetes cluster using a non-default CNI, see [Deploy Tanzu Kubernetes clusters with Calico](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-tanzu-k8s-clusters-networking.html#calico).

Each CNI is suitable for a different use case. The following table lists common use cases for the three CNIs that Tanzu Kubernetes Grid supports. This table will help you with information on selecting the right CNI in your Tanzu Kubernetes Grid implementation.

|**CNI**|**Use Case**|**Pros and Cons**|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Antrea  |<p>Enable Kubernetes pod networking with IP overlay networks using VXLAN or Geneve for encapsulation. Optionally, encrypt node-to-node communication using IPSec packet encryption.</p><p></p><p>Antrea supports advanced network use cases like kernel bypass and network service mesh.</p>|<p>Pros:</p><p>- Provide an option to configure egress IP address pool or static egress IP address for the Kubernetes workloads.</p>|
|Calico  |<p>Calico is used in environments where factors like network performance, flexibility, and power are essential.</p><p></p><p>For routing packets between nodes, Calico leverages the BGP routing protocol instead of an overlay network. This eliminates the need to wrap packets with an encapsulation layer resulting in increased network performance for Kubernetes workloads.</p>|<p>Pros:</p><p>- Support for network policies</p><p>- High network performance</p><p>- SCTP support</p><p>Cons:</p><p>- No multicast support</p>|

## Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Infrastructure Networking

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid on vSphere can be deployed on various networking stacks including

- VMware NSX-T Data Center Networking
- vSphere Networking (VDS)

**Note:** The scope of this document is limited to NSX-T Data Center Networking.

## Tanzu Kubernetes Grid on NSX-T Networking with NSX Advanced Load Balancer

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, when deployed on the VMware NSX-T Networking, uses the NSX-T logical segments and tier-1 gateways to provide connectivity to Kubernetes control plane VMs, worker nodes, services, and applications. All hosts from the cluster where Tanzu Kubernetes clusters are deployed are configured as NSX-T transport nodes that provide network connectivity to the Kubernetes environment.

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid leverages NSX Advanced Load Balancer to provide layer 4 load balancing for the Tanzu Kubernetes clusters control-plane HA and layer 4 or layer 7 for the applications deployed in the Tanzu Kubernetes clusters. Users access the applications by connecting to the virtual IP address (VIP) of the applications provisioned by NSX Advanced Load Balancer.

## NSX Advanced Load Balancer Components
NSX Advanced Load Balancer is deployed in Write Access Mode in the vSphere environment. This mode grants NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller full write access to the vCenter which helps in automatically creating, modifying, and removing service engines (SEs) and other resources as needed to adapt to changing traffic needs. The core components of NSX Advanced Load Balancer are as follows:

- **NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller** - NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller manages Virtual Service objects and interacts with the vCenter Server infrastructure to manage the lifecycle of the service engines (SEs). It is the central repository for the configurations and policies related to services and management, and it provides the portal for viewing the health of VirtualServices and SEs and the associated analytics that NSX Advanced Load Balancer provides.
- **NSX Advanced Load Balancer Service Engine** - The service engines (SEs) are lightweight VMs that handle all data plane operations by receiving and executing instructions from the controller. The SEs perform load balancing and all client- and server-facing network interactions.
- **Avi Kubernetes Operator (AKO)** - It is a Kubernetes operator that runs as a pod in the Supervisor Cluster and Tanzu Kubernetes clusters, and it provides ingress and load balancing functionality. AKO translates the required Kubernetes objects to NSX Advanced Load Balancer objects and automates the implementation of ingresses, routes, and services on the service engines (SE) through the NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller.
- **AKO Operator (AKOO)** - This is an operator which is used to deploy, manage, and remove the AKO pod in Kubernetes clusters. This operator when deployed creates an instance of the AKO controller and installs all the relevant objects like:
  - AKO `StatefulSet`
  - `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding`
  - `ConfigMap` required for the AKO controller and other artifacts.

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management clusters have an AKO operator installed out of the box during cluster deployment. By default, a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster has a couple of AkoDeploymentConfig created which dictates when and how AKO pods are created in the workload clusters. For more information, see [AKO Operator documentation](https://github.com/vmware/load-balancer-and-ingress-services-for-kubernetes/tree/master/ako-operator).

Each environment configured in NSX Advanced Load Balancer is referred to as a cloud. Each cloud in NSX Advanced Load Balancer maintains networking and NSX Advanced Load Balancer Service Engine settings. The cloud is configured with one or more VIP networks to provide IP addresses to load balancing (L4 or L7) virtual services created under that cloud.

The virtual services can span across multiple service engines if the associated Service Engine Group is configured in the Active/Active HA mode. A service engine can belong to only one Service Engine group at a time.

IP address allocation for virtual services can be over DHCP or using NSX Advanced Load Balancer in-built IPAM functionality. The VIP networks created or configured in NSX Advanced Load Balancer are associated with the IPAM profile.

## Network Architecture

For the deployment of Tanzu Kubernetes Grid in the NSX-T backed vSphere environment, it is required to build separate networks (logical segments) for the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management, shared services and workload clusters, NSX Advanced Load Balancer management, and cluster VIP network for control plane HA, Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management VIP/data network, and Tanzu Kubernetes Grid workload data/VIP network.

The network reference design can be mapped into this general framework.

![TKG General Network Layout](img/tkg-nsxt-airgap/tkg-nsxt-airgap02.jpg)

This topology enables the following benefits:

- Isolate and separate SDDC management components (vCenter, ESX) from the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid components. This reference design allows only the minimum connectivity between the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid clusters and NSX Advanced Load Balancer to the vCenter server.

- Isolate and separate the NSX Advanced Load Balancer management network from the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management segment and workload segments.

- Depending on the workload cluster type and use case, multiple workload clusters may leverage the same workload network or new networks can be used for each workload cluster. To isolate and separate Tanzu Kubernetes Grid workload cluster networking from each other, it is recommended to make use of separate networks for each workload cluster and configure the required firewall between these networks. For more information, see [Firewall Recommendations](#firewall-requirements).

- Separate provider and tenant access to the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid environment.

  - Only provider administrators need access to the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster. This prevents tenants from attempting to connect to the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster.

- Only allow tenants to access their Tanzu Kubernetes Grid workload clusters and restrict access to this cluster from other tenants.

## Network Requirements

As per the defined architecture, the list of required networks follows:

|**Network Type**|**DHCP Service**|<p>**Description & Recommendations**</p><p></p>|
| --- | --- | --- |
|NSX Advanced Load Balancer Management Network|Optional|<p>NSX Advanced Load Balancer controllers and SEs will be attached to this network. </p><p></p><p>DHCP is not a mandatory requirement on this network as NSX Advanced Load Balancer can take care of IPAM.</p>|

|TKG Management VIP/Data Network|No|Virtual services for all user-managed packages (such as Contour and Harbor) hosted on the shared services cluster.|
|TKG Workload VIP/Data Network|No|<p>Virtual services for all applications hosted on the workload clusters.</p><p>Reserve sufficient IP addresses depending on the number of applications that are planned to be hosted on the workload clusters along with scalability considerations.</p>|

## Subnet and CIDR Examples

## <a id=firewall-requirements> </a> Firewall Requirements

To prepare the firewall, you need to gather the following information:

- NSX ALB controller nodes and cluster IP address
- NSX ALB management network CIDR
- TKG management network CIDR
- TKG workload network CIDR
- TKG cluster VIP range
- TKG management VIP range
- TKG workload VIP range
- Bastion host IP address

## Installation Experience

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster is the first component that you deploy to get started with Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.

You can deploy the management cluster in two ways:

- Run the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid installer, a wizard interface that guides you through the process of deploying a management cluster.

- Create and edit YAML configuration files, and use them to deploy a management cluster with the CLI commands. This is the recommended method if you are installing a TKG Management cluster in an air-gapped environment.

The Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Installation user interface shows that, in the current version, it is possible to install Tanzu Kubernetes Grid on VMware vSphere, AWS, and Microsoft Azure. The UI provides a guided experience tailored to the IaaS, in this case on VMware vSphere backed by NSX-T Data Center networking.

![TKG Supported IaaS Platforms](img/tkg-nsxt-airgap/tkg-nsxt-airgap03.png)

The installation process will take you through the setup of a **Management Cluster** on your vSphere environment. Once the management cluster is deployed you can make use of Tanzu CLI to deploy Tanzu Kubernetes shared services and workload clusters.

To deploy the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster directly from CLI, see the supplemental information [Cluster Deployment Parameters](#deployment-parameters) for a sample yaml file used for deployment.

## Kubernetes Ingress Routing

The default installation of Tanzu Kubernetes Grid does not have any default ingress controller deployed. Users can use Contour (available for installation through Tanzu Packages) or any third-party ingress controller of their choice.

Contour is an open-source controller for Kubernetes ingress routing. Contour can be installed in the shared services cluster on any Tanzu Kubernetes cluster. Deploying Contour is a prerequisite if you want to deploy the Prometheus, Grafana, and Harbor packages on a workload cluster. 

For more information about Contour, see the [Contour](https://projectcontour.io/) website and [Implementing Ingress Control with Contour](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-packages-ingress-contour.html).

Another option is to use the NSX Advanced Load Balancer Kubernetes ingress controller (available only with the NSX ALB Enterprise license) which offers an advanced L7 ingress for containerized applications that are deployed in the Tanzu Kubernetes workload cluster.

![NSX ALB Ingress Capabilities](img/tkg-nsxt-airgap/tkg-nsxt-airgap04.png)

For more information about the NSX ALB ingress controller, see [Configuring L7 Ingress with NSX Advanced Load Balancer](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-networking-configure-l7.html).

The following table provides general recommendations on when you should use a specific ingress controller for your Kubernetes environment.

|**Ingress Controller**|**Use Cases**|
| --- | --- |
|Contour|<p>Use Contour when only north-south traffic is needed in a Kubernetes cluster. You can apply security policies for north-south traffic by defining the policies in the applications manifest file.</p><p></p><p>It's a reliable solution for simple Kubernetes workloads. </p>|
|NSX Advanced Load Balancer ingress controller|<p>Use NSX Advanced Load Balancer ingress controller when a containerized application requires features like local and global server load balancing (GSLB), web application firewall (WAF), performance monitoring, direct routing from LB to pod, etc. </p><p></p>|

## Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Monitoring

In an air-gapped environment, monitoring for the Tanzu Kubernetes clusters is provided through [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

- Prometheus is an open-source system monitoring and alerting toolkit. It can collect metrics from target clusters at specified intervals, evaluate rule expressions, display the results, and trigger alerts if certain conditions arise. The Tanzu Kubernetes Grid implementation of Prometheus includes **Alert Manager**, which you can configure to notify you when certain events occur.
- Grafana is open-source visualization and analytics software. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and explore your metrics no matter where they are stored.

Both Prometheus and Grafana are installed through user-managed Tanzu packages by creating the deployment manifests and invoking the `tanzu package install` command to deploy the packages in the Tanzu Kubernetes clusters.

The following diagram shows how the monitoring components on a cluster interact.

![TKG Monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana](img/tkg-nsxt-airgap/tkg-nsxt-airgap05.png)

You can use out-of-the-box Kubernetes dashboards or you can create new dashboards to monitor compute, network, and storage utilization of Kubernetes objects such as Clusters, Namespaces, Pods, etc. See the sample dashboards shown below:

### Namespace (Pods) Compute Resources Utilization Dashboard

![Namespace Resource Utilization Dashboard](img/tkg-nsxt-airgap/tkg-nsxt-airgap06.png)

### Namespace (Pods) Networking Utilization Dashboard

## Cluster Compute Resources Utilization Dashboard

![Cluster Compute Resources Utilization Dashboard](img/tkg-nsxt-airgap/tkg-nsxt-airgap09.png)

## Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Logging

Fluent Bit is a lightweight log processor and forwarder that allows you to collect data and logs from different sources, unify them, and send them to multiple destinations. Tanzu Kubernetes Grid includes signed binaries for Fluent Bit, that you can deploy on management clusters and on Tanzu Kubernetes clusters to provide a log-forwarding service.

Tanzu Standard Runtime includes Fluent Bit as a user-managed package for the integration with logging platforms such as vRealize LogInsight, Elasticsearch, Splunk, or other logging solutions. For information about configuring Fluent Bit to your logging provider, see [Implement Log Forwarding with Fluent Bit](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-packages-logging-fluentbit.html)

You can deploy Fluent Bit on any management cluster or Tanzu Kubernetes clusters from which you want to collect logs. First, you configure an output plugin on the cluster from which you want to gather logs, depending on the endpoint that you use. Then, you deploy Fluent Bit on the cluster as a package.

vRealize Log Insight (vRLI) provides real-time log management and log analysis with machine learning-based intelligent grouping, high-performance searching, and troubleshooting across physical, virtual, and cloud environments. vRealize Log Insight already has a deep integration with the vSphere platform where you can get key actionable insights.

## Bring Your Own Images for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Deployment

You can build custom machine images for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid to use as a VM template for the management and Tanzu Kubernetes (workload) cluster nodes that it creates. Each custom machine image packages a base operating system (OS) version and a Kubernetes version, along with any additional customizations, into an image that runs on vSphere, Microsoft Azure infrastructure, and AWS (EC2) environments.

A custom image must be based on the operating system (OS) versions that are supported by Tanzu Kubernetes Grid. The table below provides a list of the operating systems that are supported for building custom images for TKG.

|**vSphere**|**AWS**|**Azure**|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Ubuntu 20.04</p><p>Ubuntu 18.04</p><p>RHEL 7</p><p>Photon OS 3</p>|<p>Ubuntu 20.04</p><p>Ubuntu 18.04</p><p>Amazon Linux 2</p>|<p>Ubuntu 20.04</p><p>Ubuntu 18.04</p>|

## Compliance and Security

VMware published Tanzu Kubernetes releases (TKrs), along with compatible versions of Kubernetes and supporting components, use the latest stable and generally-available update of the OS version that it packages, containing all current CVE and USN fixes, as of the day that the image is built. The image files are signed by VMware and have file names that contain a unique hash identifier.

VMware provides FIPS-capable Kubernetes OVA, which can be used to deploy FIPS compliant Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management and workload clusters. Tanzu Kubernetes Grid core components such as Kubelet, Kube-apiserver, Kube-controller manager, Kube-proxy, Kube-scheduler, Kubectl, Etcd, Coredns, Containerd, and Cri-tool are made FIPS compliant by compiling them with the [BoringCrypto](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/2964) FIPS modules, an open-source cryptographic library that provides [FIPS 140-2](https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips) approved algorithms.

For a full list of configurable values, see [Tanzu CLI Configuration File Variable Reference](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-tanzu-config-reference.html).

## Configure Node Sizes

The Tanzu CLI creates the individual nodes of management clusters and Tanzu Kubernetes clusters according to the settings that you provide in the configuration file. 

On vSphere, you can configure all node VMs to have the same predefined configurations, set different predefined configurations for control plane and worker nodes, or customize the configurations of the nodes. By using these settings, you can create clusters that have nodes with different configurations from the management cluster nodes. You can also create clusters in which the control plane nodes and worker nodes have different configurations.

### Use Predefined Node Configurations

The Tanzu CLI provides the following predefined configurations for cluster nodes:

|**Size**|**CPU**|**Memory (in GB)**|**Disk (in GB)**|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Small|2|4|20|
|Medium|2|8|40|
|Large|4|16|40|
|Extra-large|8|32|80|

To create a cluster in which all of the control plane and worker node VMs are the same size, specify the `SIZE` variable. If you set the `SIZE` variable, all nodes will be created with the configuration that you set.

- `SIZE: "large"`

To create a cluster in which the control plane and worker node VMs are of different sizes, specify the `CONTROLPLANE_SIZE` and `WORKER_SIZE` options.

- `CONTROLPLANE_SIZE: "medium"`
- `WORKER_SIZE: "large"`

You can combine the `CONTROLPLANE_SIZE` and `WORKER_SIZE` options with the `SIZE` option. For example, if you specify `SIZE: "large"` with `WORKER_SIZE: "extra-large"`, the control plane nodes will be set to large and worker nodes will be set to extra-large.

- `SIZE: "large"`
- `WORKER_SIZE: "extra-large"`

### Define Custom Node Configurations

You can customize the configuration of the nodes rather than using the predefined configurations.

To use the same custom configuration for all nodes, specify the `VSPHERE_NUM_CPUS`, `VSPHERE_DISK_GIB`, and `VSPHERE_MEM_MIB` options.

- `VSPHERE_NUM_CPUS: 2`
- `VSPHERE_DISK_GIB: 40`
- `VSPHERE_MEM_MIB: 4096`

To define different custom configurations for control plane nodes and worker nodes, specify the `VSPHERE_CONTROL_PLANE_*` and `VSPHERE_WORKER_*`

- `VSPHERE_CONTROL_PLANE_NUM_CPUS: 2`
- `VSPHERE_CONTROL_PLANE_DISK_GIB: 20`
- `VSPHERE_CONTROL_PLANE_MEM_MIB: 8192`
- `VSPHERE_WORKER_NUM_CPUS: 4`
- `VSPHERE_WORKER_DISK_GIB: 40`
- `VSPHERE_WORKER_MEM_MIB: 4096`

## NSX Advanced Load Balancer Sizing Guidelines

### NSX ALB Controller Sizing Guidelines

Regardless of NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller configuration, each controller cluster can achieve up to 5000 virtual services, which is a hard limit. For further details, refer to [Sizing Compute and Storage Resources for NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller(s)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/vcf-nsx-advanced-load-balancer-v1/GUID-0B159D7A-E9ED-4C3C-B959-AC09877D26CE.html).

|**Controller Size**|**VM Configuration**|**Virtual Services**|**NSX Advanced Load Balancer SE Scale**|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Small|4 vCPUS, 12 GB RAM|0-50|0-10|
|Medium|8 vCPUS, 24 GB RAM|0-200|0-100|
|Large|16 vCPUS, 32 GB RAM|200-1000|100-200|
|Extra Large|24 vCPUS, 48 GB RAM|1000-5000|200-400|

### Service Engine Sizing Guidelines

For guidance on sizing your service engines (SEs), see [Sizing Compute and Storage Resources for NSX Advanced Load Balancer Service Engine(s)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/vcf-nsx-advanced-load-balancer-v1/GUID-149D3FFA-BF77-4B6F-B73D-A42D5375E9CF.html). 

|**Performance metric**|**1 vCPU core**|
| --- | --- |
|Throughput|4 Gb/s|
|Connections/s|40k|
|SSL Throughput|1 Gb/s|
|SSL TPS (RSA2K)|~600|
|SSL TPS (ECC)|2500|

Multiple performance vectors or features may have an impact on performance.  For instance, to achieve 1 Gb/s of SSL throughput and 2000 TPS of SSL with EC certificates, NSX ALB recommends two cores.

NSX ALB Service Engines may be configured with as little as 1 vCPU core and 1 GB RAM, or up to 36 vCPU cores and 128 GB RAM. Service Engines can be deployed in Active/Active or Active/Standby mode depending on the license tier used. NSX ALB Essentials license doesn’t support Active/Active HA mode for SE. 

The following table describes the justification and implication for  design decisions concerning service engines.

|**Decision ID**|**Design Decision**|**Design Justification**|**Design Implications**|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|TKO-ALB-SE-001|Configure the High Availability mode for SEs.|To mitigate a single point of failure for the NSX ALB data plane.|High availability for SEs is configured by setting the Elastic HA mode to Active/Active or N+M in the SE group.|
|TKO-ALB-SE-002|<p>Configure compute reservations in the SE group as follows:</p><p>vCPU: 2</p><p>Memory: 4 GB</p>|SE with just one vCPU and 1 GB (default settings in SE Group) might not be enough for production workloads.|Changing the default vCPU count in the SE Group will result in extra license core consumption.|
