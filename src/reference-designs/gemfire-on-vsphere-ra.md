# Deploy and Manage VMware Tanzu GemFire on vSphere

The *Deploy and Manage VMware Tanzu GemFire on vSphere* reference architecture describes the deployment and management of VMware Tanzu GemFire on self-managed, multi-region vSphere infrastructure. It uses a vSphere Distributed Switch (vDS) for network virtualization and NSX Advanced Load Balancer for traffic distribution and high availability. This reference architecture provides architectural best practices, deployment strategies, and operational recommendations to support a scalable, high-performance, and fault-tolerant Tanzu GemFire deployment in an enterprise-grade vSphere environment.
