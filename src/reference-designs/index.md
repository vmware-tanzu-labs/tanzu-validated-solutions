# VMware Tanzu Reference Architecture

Kubernetes is great at providing development teams with a single API to deploy, manage, and run applications. However, running, maintaining, and securing Kubernetes itself is a complex task. All the way from determining what base OS instances to use, which Kubernetes CNI & CSI to use, how to secure the Kubernetes API itself to monitoring, upgrading, and backing up of clusters, Tanzu for Kubernetes operations helps teams provision, manage, secure and maintain Kubernetes clusters on a day-to-day basis.

The following Tanzu for Kubernetes operation reference architecture shows you how to best use Tanzu components together as a solution for Kubernetes operations on your IaaS of choice. This reference architecture is tested and supported by VMware.

## Components
The following components are used in the reference architecture:

**[VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/index.html)** - Enables creation and lifecycle management operations of Kubernetes clusters.  

**[VMware Tanzu Mission Control](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Mission-Control/index.html)** - Provides a global view of Kubernetes clusters and allows for centralized policy management across all deployed and attached clusters.  

**[VMware Tanzu Observability by Wavefront](https://docs.wavefront.com)** - Provides a centralized management platform for consistently operating and securing your Kubernetes infrastructure and modern applications across multiple teams and clouds.

**[VMware Tanzu Service Mesh](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Service-Mesh/index.html)** - Provides consistent control and security for microservices, end users, and data, across all your clusters and clouds.

**[VMware NSX Advanced Load Balancer Basic Edition](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Advanced-Load-Balancer/index.html)** - Provides layer 4 service type load balancer support. NSX Advanced Load Balancer is recommended for vSphere deployments without NSX-T, or which have unique scale requirements.  

**[Pinniped](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.4/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-14/GUID-mgmt-clusters-enabling-id-mgmt.html)** - Provides identity services to Kubernetes. It is an authentication service for Kubernetes to set up integration with identity providers such as OKTA, Dex, and LDAP.

**[User-managed packages](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.4/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-14/GUID-packages-user-managed-index.html)** - Provides in-cluster and shared services to the Kubernetes clusters that are running in your Tanzu Kubernetes Grid environment.

* **[Cert Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.4/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-14/GUID-packages-cert-manager.html)** - Provides automated certificate management. It runs by default in management clusters.
* **[Contour](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.4/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-14/GUID-packages-ingress-contour.html)** - Provides layer 7 ingress control to deployed HTTP(S) applications. Tanzu Kubernetes Grid includes signed binaries for Contour. Deploying Contour is a prerequisite for deploying the Prometheus, Grafana, and Harbor extensions.
* **[ExternalDNS](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.4/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-14/GUID-packages-external-dns.html)** - Publishes DNS records for applications to DNS servers. It uses a declarative Kubernetes-native interface.
* **[Fluent Bit](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.4/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-14/GUID-packages-logging-fluentbit.html)** - Collects data and logs from different sources, unifies them, and sends them to multiple destinations. Tanzu Kubernetes Grid includes signed binaries for Fluent Bit.
* **[Prometheus](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.4/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-14/GUID-packages-monitoring.html)** - Provides out-of-the box health monitoring of Kubernetes clusters. The Tanzu Kubernetes Grid implementation of Prometheus includes Alert Manager.  You can configure Alert Manager to notify you when certain events occur.
* **[Grafana](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.4/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-14/GUID-packages-monitoring.html)** - Provides monitoring dashboards for displaying key health metrics of Kubernetes clusters. Tanzu Kubernetes Grid includes an implementation of Grafana.   
* **[Harbor Image Registry](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.4/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-14/GUID-packages-harbor-registry.html)** - Provides a centralized location to push, pull, store, and scan container images used in Kubernetes workloads. It supports storing artifacts such as Helm Charts and includes enterprise grade features such as RBAC, retention policies, automated garbage clean up, and docker hub proxying.
* **[Multus CNI](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.4/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-14/GUID-packages-cni-multus.html)** - Enables attaching multiple network interfaces to pods. Multus CNI is a container network interface (CNI) plugin for Kubernetes that lets you attach multiple network interfaces to a single pod and associate each with a different address range.
