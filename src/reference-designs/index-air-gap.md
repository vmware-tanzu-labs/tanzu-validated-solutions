# VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid 2.3 Air-Gapped Reference Design and Deployment

You can deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management clusters and Tanzu Kubernetes Grid workload clusters in air-gapped environments that do not have a physical connection to the Internet.

This documentation provides reference designs for deploying VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (informally known as TKG) in an air-gapped environment. The documentation also includes the steps to deploy VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid in an air-gapped environment on AWS.

The VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Air-Gapped Reference Design document provides steps to deploy the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management and workload clusters in a specific and validated configuration in air-gapped environments. For the generic steps to deploy the management and workload clusters on air-gapped environments, see [VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/2.3/tkg-deploy-mc/mgmt-reqs-prep-offline.html).
