## <a id=tsm> </a>Tanzu Service Mesh
VMware Tanzu Service Mesh (TSM) is an enterprise-class service mesh solution that provides consistent control and security for microservices, end-users, and data across all your clusters and clouds in the most demanding multi-cluster and multi-cloud environments.

### Onboard a Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster to Tanzu Service Mesh
You can onboard Tanzu Service Mesh with or without Tanzu Mission Control.

### Prerequisites

* (Optional) An active Tanzu Mission Control subscription.  Required only if you intend to onboard a cluster to Tanzu Service Mesh via Tanzu Mission Control.
	* Ensure that the cluster to be onboarded to Tanzu Service Mesh is attached to Tanzu Mission Control.
* An active Tanzu Service Mesh subscription.
* Workload cluster resource requirements:
    - **Nodes**: At least 3 worker nodes, each with at least 3,000 milliCPU (3 CPUs) of allocatable CPU and 6 GB of allocatable memory.
    - **DaemonSets**: The DaemonSets instantiate a pod on every node on the cluster. To run the DaemonSets, Tanzu Service Mesh requires that every node in the cluster have at least 250 milliCPU and 650 MB of memory available.
    - **Ephemeral storage**: 24 GB for the whole cluster and additionally 1 GB for each node.
    - **Pods**: Tanzu Service Mesh requires a quota of at least 3 pods for each node on the cluster and additionally at least 30 pods for the whole cluster.
* If you want to install Tanzu Service Mesh only in some of the namespaces of the cluster, decide which namespaces you want to exclude from Tanzu Service Mesh.
* If you want the cluster to connect to Tanzu Service Mesh through a proxy server, make sure that you know the details of the proxy configuration, such as the type of proxy in use (transparent or explicit), the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS), the host name or IP address of the proxy server, and the port number.
* If your corporate proxy server is configured to use a certificate for secure TLS connections, make sure that you know the location of the certificate file. The Tanzu Service Mesh agent on the cluster will use the certificate to connect to the proxy server and trust the connection.

### Onboard without Tanzu Mission Control

Do the following to onboard a cluster to Tanzu Service Mesh without Tanzu Mission Control integration.

1. Login to Tanzu Mission Control via [VMware Cloud Services](https://console.cloud.vmware.com/) page.

	**Note**: If you're onboarding your first cluster to Tanzu Service Mesh, the **Onboard Clusters** panel appears automatically when you log in to Tanzu Service Mesh console.

3. In the **Onboard Clusters** panel, enter a name for the cluster that you want to onboard.

   ![](./img/tko-saas-services/TKGS-TSM01.jpg)

4. If the cluster that’s being onboarded has to connect to Tanzu Service Mesh through a proxy server, select the **Configure a proxy to connect this cluster** check box and provide the required proxy details and pass the certificate of the proxy server.

	**Note:** If your proxy server uses a globally trusted certificate, you don't need to provide the proxy configuration in Tanzu Service Mesh. Deselect the **Configure a proxy to connect this cluster** check box.

	This article does not make use of proxy settings for demonstration purposes.

5. Click **Generate Security Token** to generate a security token. You are provided two `kubectl` commands:

    - The first one applies the `operator-deployment.yaml` file to create the required Tanzu Service Mesh objects, such as Namespace, Service Account, RoleBinding, deployments, and secret on the target cluster
    - The second one creates the required secret named `generic` under the namespace `vmware-system-tsm`

     ![](./img/tko-saas-services/TKGS-TSM02.jpg)

6. Connect to the target Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster and execute the commands obtained from previous step. A new namespace `vmware-system-tsm` is created on the target cluster.

	<!-- /* cSpell:disable */ -->

	```
	# kubectl get pods -n vmware-system-tsm
	NAME                                        READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

	k8s-cluster-manager-7b446cd99b-v2jk8        1/1     Running     1          24m
	operator-ecr-read-only--renew-token-6nd5f   0/1     Completed   0          25m
	telegraf-istio-75b8547675-nmzkr             1/1     Running     0          15m
	tsm-agent-operator-548f8997c9-5l67z         1/1     Running     0          25m
	```
	<!-- /* cSpell:enable */ -->

7. After all the required objects are created on the cluster, the Tanzu Service Mesh console prompts you to **Install Tanzu Service Mesh on the cluster**. For this deployment, Tanzu Service Mesh is installed on all namespaces.
   ![](./img/tko-saas-services/TKGS-TSM05.jpg)

   **Note**:

    - To install Tanzu Service Mesh in all the namespaces, click Install on all Namespaces. The system namespaces on the cluster, such as kube-system, kube-public, and istio-system, are excluded from Tanzu Service Mesh by default.
    - To exclude a specific namespace from Tanzu Service Mesh, click Exclude Namespaces, select Is Exactly from the left drop-down menu under Exclude Namespaces, and then enter or select the name of the namespace from the right drop-down menu.
    - You can also specify the name of a namespace that you plan to create in the cluster at some point in the future.

    ![](./img/tko-saas-services/TKGS-TSM05.jpg)

8. When the installation is complete, **Successfully Onboarded** appears next to the cluster name.

    ![](./img/tko-saas-services/TKGS-TSM07.jpg)

The Tanzu Service Mesh console displays information about the infrastructure of the onboarded cluster and any microservices deployed on the cluster. Tanzu Service Mesh also starts monitoring and collecting infrastructure and service metrics, such as the number of nodes and services, requests per second, latency, and CPU usage, from the cluster. The Home page of the Tanzu Service Mesh console provides summary information about the cluster's infrastructure, a topology view of the services in the cluster, and key metrics.

If you have a multi-cluster or hybrid-cloud application, you can connect, secure, and manage the services in the application across the clusters with a global namespace. For more information, see [Connect Services with a Global Namespace](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Service-Mesh/services/using-tanzu-service-mesh-guide/GUID-8D483355-6F58-4AAD-9EAF-3B8E0A87B474.html).
