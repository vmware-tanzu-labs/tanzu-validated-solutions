# Deploy User-Managed Packages in Workload Clusters

After creating workload clusters, you can install user-managed packages. These packages extend the core functionality of the Kubernetes clusters created by Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.

For example, you can install the Contour package to implement ingress control, the Harbor package to configure a private container registry, or the Fluent Bit, Grafana, and Prometheus packages to collect logs and metrics from your clusters.

You can install Tanzu packages via the CLI by invoking the `tanzu package install` command or directly from Tanzu Mission Control by utilizing the [**TMC Catalog**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Mission-Control/services/tanzumc-using/GUID-EF35646D-8762-41F1-95E5-D2F35ED71BA1.html) feature.

## General Instructions for Installing a Package from Tanzu Mission Control

VMware recommends installing packages on Tanzu Kubernetes clusters through Tanzu Mission Control. The general procedure for using Tanzu Mission Control to install a single package on a particular cluster is as follows:

1. Log in to the Tanzu Mission Control portal and go to the **Catalog** page. On the **Available** tab, you'll see a set of tiles that represent the packages available for installation.

1. From the dropdown list of clusters under **Available packages for cluster**, select the cluster on which to install a package.
1. Select the package to install.
1. On the package details screen for that package, click **Install Package**.
1. Configure the package. (Details for configuring common packages follow.)
1. Verify that the package is shown in the list of installed packages for that cluster and that the package **Status** is **Succeeded**.

### Install Cert-Manager

The first package that you should install on your cluster is [**cert-manager**](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager). This package adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing, and using those certificates.

Click the cert-manager package tile on the **Catalog page** to navigate to the install package page. Click **Install Package** to navigate to the package details page. The package details page shows the metadata provided by the package author.

On the package details page, click **Install Package**.

### Install Fluent Bit

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) is a lightweight log processor and forwarder that allows you to collect data and logs from different sources, unify them, and send them to multiple destinations.

You can use Fluent Bit to gather logs from management clusters or Tanzu Kubernetes clusters running in vSphere, Amazon EC2, and Azure. You can then forward them to a log storage provider such as [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/), [Kafka](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-operator/), [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/), or an HTTP endpoint.

The example shown in this document uses an HTTP endpoint [vRealize Log Insight Cloud](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vRealize-Log-Insight-Cloud/index.html) for forwarding logs from Tanzu Kubernetes clusters.

A sample YAML file for configuring an http endpoint with Fluent Bit is provided as a reference here. For a full list of user-configurable values, see the official [Fluent Bit documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-packages-logging-fluentbit.html#fluent-bit-package-configuration-parameters-4).

Before you add the following YAML code in TMC for installing Fluent Bit, you must [create an API key](https://vmc.techzone.vmware.com/resource/implement-centralized-logging-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-fluent-bit).
