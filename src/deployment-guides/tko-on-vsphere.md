## <a id="dep-config-nsx-alb"> </a>Deploy and Configure NSX Advanced Load Balancer

NSX Advanced Load Balancer (ALB) is an enterprise-grade integrated load balancer that provides L4 - L7 load balancer support. It is recommended for vSphere deployments without NSX-T, or when there are unique scaling requirements.

NSX Advanced Load Balancer is deployed in Write Access Mode in the vSphere Environment. This mode grants NSX Advanced Load Balancer controllers full write access to vCenter that helps in automatically creating, modifying, and removing service engines (SEs) and other resources as needed to adapt to changing traffic needs.

For a production-grade deployment, it is recommended to deploy three instances of the NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller for high availability and resiliency.  


The following table provides a sample IP address and FQDN set for the NSX Advanced Load Balancer controllers:  

|**Controller Node**|**IP Address**|**FQDN**|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Node 1 Primary|172.16.10.11|`alb-ctlr01.lab.vmw`|
|Node 2 Secondary|172.16.10.12|`alb-ctlr02.lab.vmw`|
|Node 3 Secondary |172.16.10.13|`alb-ctlr03.lab.vmw`|

### <a id="nsx-alb-ha"> </a>NSX Advanced Load Balancer: Controller High Availability

In a production environment, it is recommended to deploy additional controller nodes and configure the controller cluster for high availability and disaster recovery. Adding 2 additional nodes to create a 3-node cluster provides node-level redundancy for the controller and also maximizes performance for CPU-intensive analytics functions.

To run a 3-node controller cluster, you deploy the first node and perform the initial configuration, and set the cluster IP address. After that, you deploy and power on two more controller VMs, but you must not run the initial configuration wizard or change the admin password for these controllers VMs. The configuration of the first controller VM is assigned to the two new controller VMs.

The first controller of the cluster receives the Leader role. The second and third controllers work as Follower.

Complete the following steps to configure NSX Advanced Load Balancer cluster.

1. Log in to the primary NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller and go to **Administrator** > **Controller** > **Nodes**, and click **Edit**.

    ![Configure NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller node](img/tko-on-vsphere/13.ALB-Nodes.png)


2. Specify **Name** and **Controller Cluster IP**, and click **Save**. This IP address must be from the NSX Advanced Load Balancer management network.

  ![Specify NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller node name and IP](img/tko-on-vsphere/14.ALB-controller-vip.png)


3. Deploy the 2nd and 3rd NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller nodes by using steps in [Deploy NSX Advanced Load Balancer](#dep-nsx-alb).

4. Log into the primary NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller using the Controller Cluster IP/FQDN and go to **Administrator** > **Controller** >  **Nodes**, and click **Edit**. The Edit Controller Configuration popup appears.

5. In the **Cluster Nodes** field, enter the IP address for the 2nd and 3rd controller, and click **Save**.

    ![Cluster node IP address in controller configuration](img/tko-on-vsphere/15.ALB-additional-nodes.png)

    After you complete these steps, the primary NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller becomes the leader for the cluster and invites the other controllers to the cluster as members.

    NSX Advanced Load Balancer then performs a warm reboot of the cluster. This process can take approximately 10-15 minutes. You are automatically logged out of the controller node where you are currently logged in. Enter the cluster IP address in the browser, to see details about the cluster formation task.

    ![Controller initialization](img/tko-on-vsphere/16.ALB-Controller-initialization.png)

The configuration of the primary (leader) controller is synchronized to the new member nodes when the cluster comes online following the reboot. After the cluster is successfully formed, you can see the following status:

![Controller status](img/tko-on-vsphere/17.ALB-cluster.png)

**Note:** In the following tasks, all NSX Advanced Load Balancer configurations are done by connecting to the NSX ALB Controller Cluster IP/FQDN.

### <a id="nsx-alb-cert-mgmt"> </a>NSX Advanced Load Balancer: Certificate Management

The default system-generated controller certificate generated for SSL/TSL connections will not have the required subject alternate name (SAN) entries. Complete the following steps to create a controller certificate:

1. Log in to the NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller and go to **Templates** > **Security** > **SSL/TLS Certificates**.

1. Click **Create** and select **Controller Certificate**. You can either generate a self-signed certificate, generate CSR, or import a certificate. For the purpose of this document, a self-signed certificate is generated.

    ```

1. Validate Carvel tools installation using the following commands.
    ```bash
    ytt version
    kapp -version
    kbld version
    imgpkg version
    ```
1. Install `yq`. `yq` is a lightweight and portable command-line YAML processor. `yq` uses `jq`-like syntax but works with YAML and JSON files.
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/download/v4.2.0/yq_linux_amd64.tar.gz

    ```
1. Execute the following commands to start the Docker service and enable it to start at boot. Photon OS has Docker installed by default.
    ```bash
    ## Check Docker service status
    systemctl status docker

    ## Start Docker Service
    systemctl start docker

    ## To start Docker Service at boot
    systemctl enable docker
    ```
1. Execute the following commands to ensure that the bootstrap machine uses [cgroup v1](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html).
    ```bash
    docker info | grep -i cgroup

    ## You should see the following
    Cgroup Driver: cgroupfs
    ```
1. Create an SSH key pair.

   An SSH key pair is required for Tanzu CLI to connect to vSphere from the bootstrap machine.  

   The public key part of the generated key is passed during the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster deployment.
   ```bash
   ## Generate SSH key pair
   ## When prompted enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): press Enter to accept the default and provide password
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"

   ## Add the private key to the SSH agent running on your machine and enter the password you created in the previous step
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ## If the above command fails, execute "eval $(ssh-agent)" and then rerun the command
   ```
1. If your bootstrap machine runs Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux, and it has a Linux kernel built after the May 2021 Linux security patch, for example Linux 5.11 and 5.12 with Fedora, run the following command.

    `sudo sysctl net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_max=131072`

All required packages are now installed and the required configurations are in place in the bootstrap virtual machine. The next step is to deploy the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster.

### Import Base Image template for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Cluster Deployment

Before you proceed with the management cluster creation, ensure that the base image template is imported into vSphere and is available as a template. To import a base image template into vSphere:

1. Go to the [Tanzu Kubernetes Grid downloads page](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/en/downloads/details?downloadGroup=TKG-151&productId=988&rPId=49705) and download a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid OVA for the cluster nodes.
  - For the management cluster, this must be either Photon or Ubuntu based Kubernetes v1.22.5 OVA.
    Note: Custom OVA with a custom Tanzu Kubernetes release (TKr) is also supported, as described in [Build Machine Images](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-build-images-index.html).
  - For workload clusters, OVA can have any supported combination of OS and Kubernetes version, as packaged in a Tanzu Kubernetes release.

  **Note**: Make sure you download the most recent OVA base image templates in the event of security patch releases. You can find updated base image templates that include security patches on the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid product download page.

1. In the vSphere client, right-click an object in the vCenter Server inventory and select **Deploy OVF template**.

1. Select Local file, click the button to upload files, and go to the downloaded OVA file on your local machine.

1. Follow the installer prompts to deploy a VM from the OVA.

1. Click **Finish** to deploy the VM. When the OVA deployment finishes, right-click the VM and select **Template** > **Convert to Template**.

    **Note:** Do not power on the VM before you convert it to a template.

1. **If using non administrator SSO account**: In the VMs and Templates view, right-click the new template, select **Add Permission**, and assign the **tkg-user** to the template with the **TKG role**.

For information about how to create the user and role for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, see [Required Permissions for the vSphere Account](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-mgmt-clusters-vsphere.html#required-permissions-for-the-vsphere-account-5).

## <a id="deploy-mgmg-cluster"> </a>Deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) Management Cluster

The management cluster is a Kubernetes cluster that runs Cluster API operations on a specific cloud provider to create and manage workload clusters on that provider.

The management cluster is also where you configure the shared and in-cluster services that the workload clusters use.

You can deploy management clusters in two ways:

- Run the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid installer, a wizard interface that guides you through the process of deploying a management cluster. This is the recommended method.
- Create and edit YAML configuration files, and use them to deploy a management cluster with the CLI commands.

The following procedure provides the required steps to deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster using the installer interface.

1. To launch the UI installer wizard, run the following command on the bootstrap machine:  

    `tanzu management-cluster create --ui --bind <bootstrapper-ip>:<port> --browser none`  

    For example:  
    `tanzu management-cluster create --ui --bind 172.16.40.6:8000 --browser none`  

1. Access Tanzu UI wizard by opening a browser and entering: http://<bootstrapper-ip:port/  

	![Tanzu Kubernetes Grid installer UI](img/tko-on-vsphere/36-Mgmt-cluster-1.png)


2. Click Deploy on the VMware vSphere tile.
3. In the IaaS Provider section, enter the IP/FQDN and credentials of the vCenter server where the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster is deployed.

 ![IaaS provider details](img/tko-on-vsphere/37-Mgmt-cluster-2.png)

4. Click **Connect** and accept the vCenter Server SSL thumbprint.

  If you are running on a vCenter 7.x environment, the following screen displays.

    ![vCenter 7.x specific screen](img/tko-on-vsphere/38-Mgmt-cluster-3.png)

5. Select **DEPLOY TKG MANAGEMENT CLUSTER**.
6. Select the data center and provide the SSH public Key generated while configuring the bootstrap VM.  
    If you have saved the SSH key in the default location, execute the  following command in you bootstrap machine to get the SSH public key.
		cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
1. Click **Next**.  

    ![IaaS provider details after connection](img/tko-on-vsphere/39-Mgmt-cluster-4.png)

2. On the Management Cluster Settings section, provide the following details and click **Next**.

    * Based on the environment requirements, select appropriate deployment type for the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Management cluster:

        * Development: Recommended for Dev or POC environments
        * Production: Recommended for Production environments

        It is recommended to set the instance type to `Large` or above. For the purpose of this document, we will proceed with deployment type `Production` and instance type `Medium`.

    * Management Cluster Name: Name for your management cluster.
    * Control Plane Endpoint Provider: Select NSX Advanced Load Balancer for Control Plane HA.
    * Control Plane Endpoint: This is an optional field. If left blank, NSX Advanced Load Balancer will assign an IP address from the pool “tkg_cluster_vip_pg” created earlier.  
        If you need to provide an IP address, pick an IP address from “tkg_cluster_vip_pg”  static IP pools configured in AVI and ensure that the IP address is unused.
    * Machine Health Checks: Enable
    * Enable Audit Logging: Enable for audit logging for Kubernetes API server and node VMs. Choose as per your environment needs. For more information, see [Audit Logging](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-troubleshooting-tkg-audit-logging.html).

    ![Management cluster settings](img/tko-on-vsphere/40-Mgmt-cluster-5.png)

3. On the NSX Advanced Load Balancer section, provide the following information and click **Next**.

    * Controller Host: NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller IP/FQDN (Advanced Load Balancer Controller cluster IP/FQDN of the controller cluster is configured)
    * Controller credentials: Username and Password of NSX Advanced Load Balancer
    * Controller certificate: Paste the contents of the Certificate Authority that is used to generate your controller certificate into the `Controller Certificate Authority` text box.

4. After these details are provided, click **Verify Credentials** and choose the following parameters.

    * Cloud Name: Name of the cloud created while configuring NSX Advanced Load Balancer `tanzu-vcenter-01`.
    * Service Engine Group Name: Name of the service engine group created for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management clusters created while configuring NSX Advanced Load Balancer `tanzu-mgmt-segroup-01`.
    * Workload VIP Network Name: Select TKG Management VIP/Data network `tkg_mgmt_vip_pg` and select the discovered subnet.
    * Workload VIP network CIDR: Select the discovered subnet, `172.16.50.0/24`
    * Management VIP network Name: Select TKG Cluster VIP/Data network `tkg_cluster_vip_pg`.
    * Cluster Labels: To adhere to the architecture defining a label is mandatory. Provide required labels, for example, `type: management`.

		**Note:** Based on your requirements, you can specify multiple labels.

    ![NSX Advanced Load Balancer settings for management cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/41-Mgmt-cluster-6.png)

    **Note:** With the above configurations, when Tanzu Kubernetes Grid clusters (shared service/workload) are tagged with label `type: management`, an `ako` pod gets deployed on the cluster. Applications hosted on the cluster that require the load balancing service are exposed through network `tkg_mgmt_vip_pg` and the virtual service is placed on the SE group `tanzu-mgmt-segroup-01`.  

    As defined in the architecture, cluster labels specified here are applied only on the shared service cluster. If no labels are specified in the “Cluster Labels” section, the `ako` pod is deployed on all the clusters without any labeling requirement. This is a deviation from the defined architecture.
                
1. (Optional) On the Metadata page, you can specify location and labels and click **Next**.

    ![Metadata page for management cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/42-Mgmt-cluster-7.png)

2. On the Resources section, specify the resources to be consumed by Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster and click **Next**.  
    ![resources page for management cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/43-Mgmt-cluster-8.png)

3. On the Kubernetes Network section, select the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management network (`tkg_mgmt_pg`) where the control plane and worker nodes are placed during management cluster deployment. Ensure that the network has DHCP service enabled. Optionally, change the pod and service CIDR.

    If the Tanzu environment is placed behind a proxy, enable proxy and provide proxy details:

    * If you set `http-proxy`, you must also set `https-proxy` and vice-versa.
    * For the `no-proxy` section:

      * For Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management and workload clusters, `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, the values of `CLUSTER_CIDR` and `SERVICE_CIDR`, `.svc`, and `.svc.cluster.local` are appended along with the user specified values.
    * **Note**: If the Kubernetes cluster needs to communicate with external services and infrastructure endpoints in your Tanzu Kubernetes Grid environment, ensure that those endpoints are reachable by your proxies or add them to `TKG_NO_PROXY`. Depending on your environment configuration, this may include, but is not limited to, your OIDC or LDAP server, Harbor, NSX-T, NSX Advanced Load Balancer, and vCenter.
    * For vSphere, you must manually add the CIDR of Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management network and Cluster VIP networks that includes the IP address of your control plane endpoints, to `TKG_NO_PROXY`.

    ![Kubernetes Network page for management cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/44-Mgmt-cluster-9.png)

4. (Optional) Specify identity management with OIDC or LDAP. For this deployment, deactivate identity management integration.

    If you would like to enable Identity Management, see [Enable and Configure Identity Management During Management Cluster Deployment](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-for-Kubernetes-Operations/1.5/tko-reference-architecture/GUID-deployment-guides-pinniped-with-tkg.html#enable-and-configure-identity-management-during-management-cluster-deployment-0).

    ![Identity management for management cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/45-Mgmt-cluster-10.png)  

5. Select the OS image to use for deploying the management cluster 
     
    **Note:** This list will appear empty if you don’t have a compatible template present in your environment. See the steps provided in [Import Base Image Template into vSphere](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-mgmt-clusters-vsphere.html#import-a-base-image-template-into-vsphere-4).

    ![OS image for management cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/46-Mgmt-cluster-11.png)


6. Check the “Participate in the Customer Experience Improvement Program”, if you so desire, and click **Review Configuration**.
7. Review the configuration. After reviewing the configuration, you can either copy the command provided and execute it in CLI or proceed with UI to deploy the management cluster.  

    When the deployment is triggered from the UI, the installer wizard displays the deployment logs on the screen.

    ![Deployment logs in installer UI](img/tko-on-vsphere/47-Mgmt-cluster-12.png)

While the cluster is being deployed, you will find that a virtual service is created in NSX Advanced Load Balancer and new service engines are deployed in vCenter by NSX Advanced Load Balancer and the service engines are mapped to the SE Group `tanzu-mgmt-segroup-01`.​​

When Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster is being deployed, behind the scenes:  

* NSX Advanced Load Balancer service engines get deployed in vCenter and this task is orchestrated by the NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller.
* Service engine status in NSX Advanced Load Balancer: The following snippet shows the service engines status. They are in the initializing state for sometime and then the status changes to Up.

    ![Service engine status](img/tko-on-vsphere/48-Mgmt-cluster-11.png)

* Service engine group status in NSX Advanced Load Balancer: As per the configuration, the virtual service required for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid clusters control plane HA are hosted on service engine group `tkg-mgmt-segroup-01`.  

    ![Service engine group status](img/tko-on-vsphere/50-Mgmt-cluster-15.png)

* Virtual service status in NSX Advanced Load Balancer: The cluster is configured with Production type that deployed 3 control plane nodes, which are placed behind the cluster VIP.

    ![Virtual service status dashboard](img/tko-on-vsphere/51-Mgmt-cluster-16.png)

    ![Virtual service status](img/tko-on-vsphere/52-Mgmt-cluster-17.png)

* After the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster is successfully deployed, the Tanzu Bootstrap UI displays the following status.
    ![UI message after deployment completion](img/tko-on-vsphere/53-Mgmt-cluster-18.png)

* The installer will automatically set the context to the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster on the bootstrap machine. Now you can access the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster from the bootstrap machine and perform additional tasks such as verifying the management cluster health and deploying the workload clusters, etc.

    To get the status of Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster, execute the following command:

    `tanzu management-cluster get`

    ![Management cluster status CLI output](img/tko-on-vsphere/54-Mgmt-cluster-19.png)

   Use `kubectl` to get the status of the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster nodes.

    ![Management cluster nodes status CLI output](img/tko-on-vsphere/55-Mgmt-cluster-20.png)


## <a id="register-tmc"> </a>Register Management Cluster with Tanzu Mission Control

 If you want to register your management cluster with Tanzu Mission Control, see [Register Your Management Cluster with Tanzu Mission Control](./tko-saas-services.md#a-idtmc-a-tanzu-mission-control).

## Deploy Tanzu Shared Service Cluster  

Each Tanzu Kubernetes Grid instance can have only one shared services cluster. Create a shared services cluster if you intend to deploy Harbor.  

The procedures for deploying a shared service cluster and workload cluster are almost the same. A key difference is that for the shared service cluster you add the `tanzu-services` label to the shared services cluster, as its cluster role. This label identifies the shared services cluster to the management cluster and workload clusters.  

Another difference between the shared services cluster and workload clusters is that shared services clusters are applied with the “Cluster Labels” which were defined while deploying the management cluster. This is to enforce that only shared service cluster will make use of the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid cluster VIP or data network for application load balancing purposes and the virtual services are deployed on “Service Engine Group 1”.

After the management cluster is registered with Tanzu Mission Control, the deployment of the Tanzu Kubernetes clusters can be done in just a few clicks. The procedure for creating Tanzu Kubernetes clusters is as follows.

1. Navigate to the Clusters tab and click **Create Cluster**.

2. Under the Create cluster page, select the management cluster which you registered in the previous step and click **Continue to create cluster**.

    ![Select management cluster for shared services cluster ](img/tko-on-vsphere/65-shared-service-1.png)

3. Select the provisioner for creating the workload cluster (shared services cluster). Provisioner reflects the vSphere namespaces that you have created and associated with the management cluster.

    ![Select provisioner for shared services cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/66-shared-service-2.png)

4. Enter a name for the cluster and select the cluster group to which you want to attach your cluster. Cluster names must be unique within an organization. For the cluster group, you can optionally enter a description and apply labels.

    ![Cluster name and cluster group](img/tko-on-vsphere/67-shared-service-3.png)

5. On the Configure page, specify the following items:

 * Select the Kubernetes version to use for the cluster. The latest supported version is preselected for you. You can choose the desired Kubernetes version by clicking on the down arrow button.
 * You can optionally define an alternative CIDR for the pod and the service. The pod CIDR and service CIDR cannot be changed after the cluster is created.
 * You can optionally specify a proxy configuration to use for this cluster.

    **Note:** The scope of this document doesn't cover the use of a proxy for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid deployment. If your environment uses a proxy server to connect to the internet, ensure that the proxy configuration object includes the CIDRs for the pod, ingress, and egress from the workload network of the Management Cluster in the **No proxy list**, as described in [Create a Proxy Configuration Object for a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service Cluster Running in vSphere with Tanzu](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Mission-Control/services/tanzumc-using/GUID-B4760775-388A-45B5-A707-2191E9E4F41F.html#GUID-B4760775-388A-45B5-A707-2191E9E4F41F).

    ![Kubernetes version, network and storage options](img/tko-on-vsphere/68-shared-service-4.png)

6.  Select the resources for backing this cluster. Provide the resource pool, VM folder, and datastore information.

    ![Resources backing the cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/69-shared-service-5.png)

7. Select the high availability mode for the control plane nodes of the workload cluster. For a production deployment, it is recommended to deploy a highly available workload cluster.

    ![Select between single node and HA mode for control plane](img/tko-on-vsphere/70-shared-service-6.png)

8. Customize the default node pool for your workload cluster.

    * Specify the number of worker nodes to provision.
    * Select the instance type.

1. Click **Create Cluster** to start provisioning your workload cluster.

    ![Start cluster provisioning](img/tko-on-vsphere/71-shared-service-7.png)

2. After the cluster is created, you can check the status from Tanzu Mission Control.

    ![Cluster status after provisioning](img/tko-on-vsphere/72-shared-service-8.png)


	Cluster creation takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. After the cluster deployment completes, ensure that agent and extensions health shows green.

    ![Agent and extensions health status](img/tko-on-vsphere/73-shared-service-9.png)

3. Connect to the Tanzu Management Cluster context and apply the following labels.
<!-- /* cSpell:disable */ -->
  ```bash
  ## Connect to tkg management cluster

  kubectl config use-context tkg-mgmt01-admin@tkg-mgmt01

  ## verify the shared service cluster creation

  tanzu cluster list
  NAME            NAMESPACE  STATUS   CONTROLPLANE  WORKERS  KUBERNETES        ROLES   PLAN
  tkg-shared-svc  default    running  3/3           3/3      v1.22.5+vmware.1  <none>  prod

  ## Add the tanzu-services label to the shared services cluster as its cluster role. In the following command “tkg-shared-svc” is the name of the shared service cluster

  kubectl label cluster.cluster.x-k8s.io/tkg-shared-svc cluster-role.tkg.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-services="" --overwrite=true

  ## Tag shared service cluster with all “Cluster Labels” defined while deploying Management Cluster, once the “Cluster Labels” are applied AKO pod will be deployed on the Shared Service Cluster

  kubectl label cluster tkg-shared-svc type=management

  ```
<!-- /* cSpell:enable */ -->

12. Get the admin context of the shared service cluster using the following commands and switch the context to the shared service cluster.
<!-- /* cSpell:disable */ -->
  ```bash
  ## Use the following command to get the admin context of Shared Service Cluster. In the following command “tkg-shared-svc” is the name of the shared service cluster

  tanzu cluster kubeconfig get tkg-shared-svc --admin

  ## Use the following command to use the context of Shared Service Cluster

  kubectl config use-context tkg-shared-svc-admin@tkg-shared-svc

  # Verify that ako pod gets deployed in avi-system namespace

  kubectl get pods -n avi-system
  NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  ako-0   1/1     Running   0          41s

  ```
<!-- /* cSpell:enable */ -->

Now that the shared service cluster is successfully created, you may proceed with deploying the Harbor package.


## <a id="dep-workload-cluster"> </a>Deploy Tanzu Workload Clusters

As per the architecture, workload clusters make use of a separate SE group (**Service Engine Group 2)** and VIP Network (**TKG Workload VIP/Data Network**) for application load balancing. This can be controlled by creating a new **AKODeploymentConfig**. For more information, see [Create and deploy AKO Deployment Config for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Workload Cluster](#configure-nsx-advanced-load-balancer-in-tkg-workload-cluster).

Complete the following steps to deploy workload clusters from Tanzu Mission Control:

1.  Navigate to the Clusters tab and click **Create Cluster**.

### <a id="workloadalb"> </a> Configure NSX Advanced Load Balancer in Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Workload Cluster

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid v1.5.x management clusters with NSX Advanced Load Balancer are deployed with 2 AKODeploymentConfigs.

* `install-ako-for-management-cluster`: default config for management cluster
* `install-ako-for-all`:  default config for all Tanzu Kubernetes Grid clusters. By default, any clusters that match the cluster labels defined in `install-ako-for-all` will reference this file for their virtual IP networks, service engine (SE) groups, and L7 ingress. As part of this architecture, only shared service cluster makes use of the configuration defined in the default AKODeploymentConfig `install-ako-for-all`.

As per the defined architecture, workload clusters must not make use of **Service Engine Group 1** and VIP Network **TKG Cluster VIP/Data Network** for application load balancer services.
A separate SE group (**Service Engine Group 2)** and VIP Network (**TKG Workload VIP/Data Network**) are used by the workload clusters. These configurations can be enforced on workload clusters by:

* Creating a new AKODeploymentConfig in the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster. This AKODeploymentConfig file dictates which specific SE group and VIP network that the workload clusters can use for load balancer functionalities  
* Apply the new AKODeploymentConfig:  Label the workload cluster to match the `AKODeploymentConfig.spec.clusterSelector.matchLabels` element in the AKODeploymentConfig file.
  After the labels are applied on the workload cluster, Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster will deploy AKO pod on the target workload cluster which has the configuration defined in the new AKODeploymentConfig.

The format of the AKODeploymentConfig YAML file is as follows.

The sample AKODeploymentConfig with sample values in place is as follows. As per the following configuration, Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster deploys AKO pod on any workload cluster that matches the label `type=workloadset01` and the AKO configuration is as follows:

- cloud: ​`tanzu-vcenter-01​`
- service engine group: `tanzu-wkld-segroup-01`
- Control Plane network: `tkg_workload_pg`
- VIP/data network: `tkg_workload_vip_pg`

After you have the AKO configuration file ready, use the `kubectl` command to set the context to Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster and use the following command to list the available AKODeploymentConfig:

<!-- /* cSpell:disable */ -->
```
kubectl apply -f <path_to_akodeploymentconfig.yaml>
```
<!-- /* cSpell:enable */ -->

Use the following command to list all AKODeploymentConfig created under the management cluster:

<!-- /* cSpell:disable */ -->
```
kubectl get adc  or
kubectl get akodeploymentconfig
```
<!-- /* cSpell:enable */ -->

Now that you have successfully created the AKO deployment config, you need to apply the cluster labels defined in the AKODeploymentConfig to any of the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid workload clusters. After the labels are applied, Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster will deploy AKO pod on the target workload cluster.

<!-- /* cSpell:disable */ -->
```
kubectl label cluster <Cluster_Name> <label>
```
<!-- /* cSpell:enable */ -->

### Connect to Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Workload Cluster and Validate the Deployment

Now that you have created the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid workload cluster and the required AKO configurations are applied, use the following command to get the admin context of the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid workload cluster.

<!-- /* cSpell:disable */ -->
```
tanzu cluster kubeconfig get <cluster-name> --admin
```
<!-- /* cSpell:enable */ -->

Connect to the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid workload cluster using the `kubectl` command and run the following commands to check the status of AKO and other components.

<!-- /* cSpell:disable */ -->
```bash
## List all nodes with status

kubectl get nodes  

## To check the status of AKO pod

kubectl get pods -n avi-system

## Lists all pods and it’s status

kubectl get pods -A   
```
<!-- /* cSpell:enable */ -->
