## <a id="dep-config-nsx-alb"> </a> Deploy and Configure NSX Advanced Load Balancer

NSX Advanced Load Balancer (ALB) is an enterprise-grade integrated load balancer that provides L4 - L7 load balancer support. It is recommended for vSphere deployments without NSX-T, or when there are unique scaling requirements.

NSX Advanced Load Balancer is deployed in Write Access Mode in the vSphere Environment. This mode grants NSX Advanced Load Balancer controllers full write access to vCenter that helps in automatically creating, modifying, and removing service engines (SEs) and other resources as needed to adapt to changing traffic needs.

For a production-grade deployment, it is recommended to deploy three instances of the NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller for high availability and resiliency.  

The following table provides a sample IP address and FQDN set for the NSX Advanced Load Balancer controllers:  

|**Controller Node**|**IP Address**|**FQDN**|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Node 1 Primary|172.16.10.11|`sfo01albctlr01a.sfo01.rainpole.local`|
|Node 2 Secondary|172.16.10.12|`sfo01albctlr01b.sfo01.rainpole.local`|
|Node 3 Secondary |172.16.10.13|`sfo01albctlr01c.sfo01.rainpole.local`|

### <a id="nsx-alb-ha"> </a> NSX Advanced Load Balancer: Controller High Availability

In a production environment, it is recommended to deploy additional controller nodes and configure the controller cluster for high availability and disaster recovery. Adding 2 additional nodes to create a 3-node cluster provides node-level redundancy for the controller and also maximizes performance for CPU-intensive analytics functions.

To run a 3-node controller cluster, you deploy the first node and perform the initial configuration, and set the cluster IP address. After that, you deploy and power on two more controller VMs, but you must not run the initial configuration wizard or change the admin password for these controllers VMs. The configuration of the first controller VM is assigned to the two new controller VMs.

The first controller of the cluster receives the Leader role. The second and third controllers work as Follower.

Complete the following steps to configure NSX Advanced Load Balancer cluster.

1. Log in to the primary NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller and go to **Administrator** > **Controller** > **Nodes**, and click **Edit**.

    ![Configure NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller node](img/tko-on-vsphere/13.ALB-Nodes.png)

2. Specify **Name** and **Controller Cluster IP**, and click **Save**. This IP address must be from the NSX Advanced Load Balancer management network.

    ![Specify NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller node name and IP address](img/tko-on-vsphere/14.ALB-controller-vip.png)

3. Deploy the 2nd and 3rd NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller nodes by using steps in [Deploy NSX Advanced Load Balancer](#dep-nsx-alb).

4. Log into the primary NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller using the Controller Cluster IP/FQDN and go to **Administrator** > **Controller** >  **Nodes**, and click **Edit**. The Edit Controller Configuration popup appears.

5. In the **Cluster Nodes** field, enter the IP address for the 2nd and 3rd controller, and click **Save**.

    ![Cluster node IP address in controller configuration](img/tko-on-vsphere/15.ALB-additional-nodes.png)

    After you complete these steps, the primary NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller becomes the leader for the cluster and invites the other controllers to the cluster as members.

    NSX Advanced Load Balancer then performs a warm reboot of the cluster. This process can take approximately 10-15 minutes. You are automatically logged out of the controller node where you are currently logged in. Enter the cluster IP address in the browser, to see details about the cluster formation task.

    ![Controller initialization](img/tko-on-vsphere/16.ALB-Controller-initialization.png)

The configuration of the primary (leader) controller is synchronized to the new member nodes when the cluster comes online following the reboot. After the cluster is successfully formed, you can see the following status:

![Controller status](img/tko-on-vsphere/17.ALB-cluster.png)

**Note:** In the following tasks, all NSX Advanced Load Balancer configurations are done by connecting to the NSX ALB Controller Cluster IP/FQDN.

### <a id="nsx-alb-cert-mgmt"> </a> NSX Advanced Load Balancer: Certificate Management

The default system-generated controller certificate generated for SSL/TSL connections will not have the required subject alternate name (SAN) entries. Complete the following steps to create a controller certificate:

1. Log in to the NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller and go to **Templates** > **Security** > **SSL/TLS Certificates**.

1. Click **Create** and select **Controller Certificate**. You can either generate a self-signed certificate, generate CSR, or import a certificate. For the purpose of this document, a self-signed certificate is generated.

This completes the NSX Advanced Load Balancer configuration. The next step is to deploy and configure a bootstrap machine. The bootstrap machine is used to deploy and manage Tanzu Kubernetes clusters.

## <a id="bootstrap"> </a> Deploy and Configure Bootstrap Machine

The deployment of the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management and workload clusters is facilitated by setting up a bootstrap machine where you install the Tanzu CLI and Kubectl utilities which are used to create and manage the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid instance. This machine also keeps the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid and Kubernetes configuration files for your deployments. The bootstrap machine can be a laptop, host, or server running on Linux, macOS, or Windows that you deploy management and workload clusters from.

The bootstrap machine runs a local `kind` cluster when Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster deployment is started. Once the `kind` cluster is fully initialized, the configuration is used to deploy the actual management cluster on the backend infrastructure. After the management cluster is fully configured, the local `kind` cluster is deleted and future configurations are performed with the Tanzu CLI.

For this deployment, a Photon-based virtual machine is used as the bootstrap machine. For information on how to configure for a macOS or Windows machine, see [Install the Tanzu CLI and Other Tools](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/2.1/tkg-deploy-mc-21/install-cli.html).

The bootstrap machine must meet the following prerequisites:

   * A minimum of 6 GB of RAM and a 2-core CPU.
   * System time is synchronized with a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server.
   * Docker and containerd binaries are installed. For instructions on how to install Docker, see [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/).
   * Ensure that the bootstrap VM is connected to Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management network, `sfo01-w01-vds01-tkgmanagement`.

To install Tanzu CLI, Tanzu Plugins, and Kubectl utility on the bootstrap machine, follow the instructions below:

1. Download and unpack the following Linux CLI packages from [VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Download Product page](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/downloads/info/slug/infrastructure_operations_management/vmware_tanzu_kubernetes_grid/2_x).

   * VMware Tanzu CLI 2.1.0 for Linux
   * kubectl cluster cli v1.24.9 for Linux

1. Execute the following commands to install Tanzu Kubernetes Grid CLI, kubectl CLIs, and Carvel tools.
    ```bash

    ```

1. Validate Carvel tools installation using the following commands.

    ```bash
    ytt version
    kapp version
    kbld version
    imgpkg version
    ```

1. Install `yq`. `yq` is a lightweight and portable command-line YAML processor. `yq` uses `jq`-like syntax but works with YAML and JSON files.

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/download/v4.24.5/yq_linux_amd64.tar.gz

    tar -xvf yq_linux_amd64.tar.gz && mv yq_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/yq
    ```

1. Install `kind`.

    ```bash
    curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.11.1/kind-linux-amd64
    chmod +x ./kind
    mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
    ```

1. Execute the following commands to start the Docker service and enable it to start at boot. Photon OS has Docker installed by default.

    ```bash
    ## Check Docker service status
    systemctl status docker

    ## Start Docker Service
    systemctl start docker

    ## To start Docker Service at boot
    systemctl enable docker
    ```

1. Execute the following commands to ensure that the bootstrap machine uses [cgroup v1](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html).

    ```bash
    docker info | grep -i cgroup

    ## You should see the following
    Cgroup Driver: cgroupfs
    ```

1. Create an SSH key pair.

   An SSH key pair is required for Tanzu CLI to connect to vSphere from the bootstrap machine.  

   The public key part of the generated key is passed during the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster deployment.

   ```bash
   ## Generate SSH key pair
   ## When prompted enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): press Enter to accept the default and provide password
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"

   ## Add the private key to the SSH agent running on your machine and enter the password you created in the previous step
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ## If the above command fails, execute "eval $(ssh-agent)" and then rerun the command
   ```

1. If your bootstrap machine runs Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux, and it has a Linux kernel built after the May 2021 Linux security patch, for example Linux 5.11 and 5.12 with Fedora, run the following command.

   ```
    sudo sysctl net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_max=131072
   ```

All required packages are now installed and the required configurations are in place in the bootstrap virtual machine. The next step is to deploy the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster.

### Import Base Image template for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Cluster Deployment

Before you proceed with the management cluster creation, ensure that the base image template is imported into vSphere and is available as a template. To import a base image template into vSphere:

1. Go to the [Tanzu Kubernetes Grid downloads page](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/downloads/info/slug/infrastructure_operations_management/vmware_tanzu_kubernetes_grid/2_x) and download a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid OVA for the cluster nodes.

* For the management cluster, this must be either Photon or Ubuntu based Kubernetes v1.24.9 OVA.

     **Note**: Custom OVA with a custom Tanzu Kubernetes release (TKr) is also supported, as described in [Build Machine Images](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/2.1/tkg-deploy-mc-21/mgmt-byoi-index.html).
* For workload clusters, OVA can have any supported combination of OS and Kubernetes version, as packaged in a Tanzu Kubernetes release.

    **Note**: Make sure you download the most recent OVA base image templates in the event of security patch releases. You can find updated base image templates that include security patches on the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid product download page.

1. In the vSphere client, right-click an object in the vCenter Server inventory and select **Deploy OVF template**.

1. Select Local file, click the button to upload files, and go to the downloaded OVA file on your local machine.

1. Follow the installer prompts to deploy a VM from the OVA.

1. Click **Finish** to deploy the VM. When the OVA deployment finishes, right-click the VM and select **Template** > **Convert to Template**.

    **Note:** Do not power on the VM before you convert it to a template.

1. **If using non administrator SSO account**: In the VMs and Templates view, right-click the new template, select **Add Permission**, and assign the **tkg-user** to the template with the **TKG role**.

For information about how to create the user and role for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, see [Required Permissions for the vSphere Account](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/2.1/tkg-deploy-mc-21/mgmt-reqs-prep-vsphere.html).

## <a id="deploy-mgmg-cluster"> </a> Deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) Management Cluster

The management cluster is a Kubernetes cluster that runs Cluster API operations on a specific cloud provider to create and manage workload clusters on that provider.

The management cluster is also where you configure the shared and in-cluster services that the workload clusters use.

You can deploy management clusters in two ways:

* Run the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid installer, a wizard interface that guides you through the process of deploying a management cluster. This is the recommended method.
* Create and edit YAML configuration files, and use them to deploy a management cluster with the CLI commands.

The following procedure provides the required steps to deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster using the installer interface.

1. To launch the UI installer wizard, run the following command on the bootstrap machine:  

    ```
    tanzu management-cluster create --ui --bind <bootstrapper-ip>:<port> --browser none  
    ```

    For example:  

    ```
    tanzu management-cluster create --ui --bind 172.16.40.6:8000 --browser none
    ```

1. Access Tanzu UI wizard by opening a browser and entering: `http://<bootstrapper-ip:port/`  

	![Tanzu Kubernetes Grid installer UI](img/tko-on-vsphere/36-Mgmt-cluster-1.png)

1. Click the Deploy on the VMware vSphere tile.

1. In the IaaS Provider section, enter the IP/FQDN and credentials of the vCenter server where the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster is deployed.

   **Note:** Do not provide a vSphere administrator account to Tanzu Kubernetes Grid. Instead, create a custom role and user account with the required permissions specified in [Required Permissions for the vSphere Account](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/2.1/tkg-deploy-mc-21/mgmt-reqs-prep-vsphere.html).<p> 

    ![IaaS provider details](img/tko-on-vsphere/37-Mgmt-cluster-2.png)

1. Click **Connect** and accept the vCenter Server SSL thumbprint.

    If you are running on a vCenter 7.x environment, the following screen displays.

    ![IaaS provider details after connection](img/tko-on-vsphere/38-Mgmt-cluster-3.png)

1. Select **DEPLOY TKG MANAGEMENT CLUSTER**.

1. Select the data center and provide the SSH public Key generated while configuring the bootstrap VM.  
    If you have saved the SSH key in the default location, run the  following command in you bootstrap machine to get the SSH public key.

    ```
     cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```

1. Click **Next**.  

    ![IaaS provider details after connection](img/tko-on-vsphere/39-Mgmt-cluster-4.png)

1. On the Management Cluster Settings section, provide the following details and click **Next**.

    * Based on the environment requirements, select appropriate deployment type for the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Management cluster:

        * Development: Recommended for Dev or POC environments
        * Production: Recommended for Production environments

        It is recommended to set the instance type to `Large` or above. For the purpose of this document, we will proceed with deployment type `Production` and instance type `Medium`.

    * Management Cluster Name: Name for your management cluster.
    * Control Plane Endpoint Provider: Select NSX Advanced Load Balancer for Control Plane HA.
    * Control Plane Endpoint: This is an optional field. If left blank, NSX Advanced Load Balancer will assign an IP address from the pool “sfo01-w01-vds01-tkgclustervip” created earlier.  
        If you need to provide an IP address, pick an IP address from “sfo01-w01-vds01-tkgclustervip”  static IP pools configured in NSX_ALB and ensure that the IP address is unused.
    * Machine Health Checks: Enable. You can activate or deactivate MachineHealthCheck on clusters after deployment by using the CLI. For instructions, see [Configure Machine Health Checks for Workload Clusters](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/2.1/using-tkg-21/workload-clusters-mhc.html).

    * Enable Audit Logging: Enable for audit logging for Kubernetes API server and node VMs. Choose as per your environment needs. For more information, see [Audit Logging](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/2.1/tkg-deploy-mc-21/mgmt-troubleshoot-audit-logging.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIIIFcAmBLALgAgDIHsDmeKAdniAL5A).

     ![Management cluster settings](img/tko-on-vsphere/40-Mgmt-cluster-5.png)

1. On the NSX Advanced Load Balancer section, provide the following information and click **Next**.

    * Controller Host: NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller IP/FQDN (IP/FQDN of the Advanced Load Balancer controller cluster configured)
    * Controller credentials: Username and Password of NSX Advanced Load Balancer
    * Controller certificate: Paste the contents of the Certificate Authority that is used to generate your controller certificate into the `Controller Certificate Authority` text box.

        ![NSX Advanced Load Balancer settings for management cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/41-Mgmt-cluster-alb.png)

1. After these details are provided, click **Verify Credentials** and choose the following parameters.

    **Note:** In Tanzu Kubernetes Grid v2.1.0, you can configure the network to separate the endpoint VIP network of the cluster from the external IP network of the load balancer service and the ingress service in the cluster. This feature lets you ensure the security of the clusters by providing you an option to expose the endpoint of your management or the workload cluster and the load balancer service and ingress service in the cluster, in different networks.

    As per the Tanzu for Kubernetes Operations 2.1 Reference Architecture, all the control plane endpoints connected to Tanzu Kubernetes Grid cluster VIP network and data plane networks are connected to respective management data VIP network or workload data VIP network.

    * **Cloud Name**: Name of the cloud created while configuring NSX Advanced Load Balancer `sfo01w01vc01`.
    * **Workload Cluster service Engine Group Name**: Name of the service engine group created for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid workload clusters created while configuring NSX Advanced Load Balancer `sfo01w01segroup01`.
    * **Workload Cluster Data Plane VIP Network Name & CIDR**: Select Tanzu Kubernetes Grid workload data network `sfo01-w01-vds01-tkgworkloadvip` and the subnet `172.16.70.0/24` associated with it.
    * **Workload Cluster Control Plane VIP Network Name & CIDR**: Select Tanzu Kubernetes Grid cluster VIP network `sfo01-w01-vds01-tkgclustervip` and the subnet `172.16.80.0/24` associated with it.

    * **Management Cluster service Engine Group Name**: Name of the service engine group created for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster created while configuring NSX Advanced Load Balancer `sfo01m01segroup01`.
    * **Management Cluster Data Plane VIP Network Name & CIDR**: Select Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management data network `sfo01-w01-vds01-tkgmanagementvip` and the subnet `172.16.50.0/24` associated with it.
    * **Management Cluster Control Plane VIP Network Name & CIDR**: Select Tanzu Kubernetes Grid cluster VIP network `sfo01-w01-vds01-tkgclustervip` and the subnet `172.16.80.0/24` associated with it.

    * **Cluster Labels**: Optional. Leave the cluster labels section empty to apply the above workload cluster network settings by default. If you specify any label here, you must specify the same values in the configuration YAML file of the workload cluster. Else, the system places the endpoint VIP of your workload cluster in `Management Cluster Data Plane VIP Network` by default.

        ![NSX Advanced Load Balancer settings for management cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/41-Mgmt-cluster-6.png)

    **Note:** With the above configuration, all the Tanzu workload clusters use `sfo01-w01-vds01-tkgclustervip` for control plane VIP network and `sfo01-w01-vds01-tkgworkloadvip` for  data plane network by default. If you would like to configure separate VIP networks for workload control plane/data networks, create a custom AKO Deployment Config (ADC) and provide the respective `NSXALB_LABELS` in the workload cluster config file. For more information on network separation and custom ADC creation, see [Configure Separate VIP Networks and Service Engine Groups in Different Workload Clusters](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/2.1/tkg-deploy-mc-21/mgmt-reqs-network-nsx-alb-cp-endpoint.html)

1. (Optional) On the Metadata page, you can specify location and labels and click **Next**.

    ![Metadata page for management cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/42-Mgmt-cluster-7.png)

1. On the Resources section, specify the resources to be consumed by Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster and click **Next**.  
    ![resources page for management cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/43-Mgmt-cluster-8.png)

1. On the Kubernetes Network section, select the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management network (`sfo01-w01-vds01-tkgmanagement`) where the control plane and worker nodes are placed during management cluster deployment. Ensure that the network has DHCP service enabled. Optionally, change the pod and service CIDR.

    If the Tanzu environment is placed behind a proxy, enable proxy and provide proxy details:

    * If you set `http-proxy`, you must also set `https-proxy` and vice-versa. You can choose to use one proxy for HTTP traffic and another proxy for HTTPS traffic or to use the same proxy for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

    * Under the `no-proxy` section, enter a comma-separated list of network CIDRs or host names that must bypass the HTTP(S) proxy.

        Your **No Proxy** list must include the following:
      * The IP address or hostname for vCenter. Traffic to vCenter cannot be proxied.

      * The CIDR of the vSphere network that you selected under Network Name. The vSphere network CIDR includes the IP address of your control plane endpoint. If you entered an FQDN under control plane endpoint, add both the FQDN and the vSphere network CIDR to the `no-proxy` section.

      * Internally, Tanzu Kubernetes Grid appends `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, the values of `Cluster Pod CIDR` and `Cluster Service CIDR`, `.svc`, and `.svc.cluster.local` to the list that you enter in this field.

      **Note**: If the Kubernetes cluster needs to communicate with external services and infrastructure endpoints in your Tanzu Kubernetes Grid environment, ensure that those endpoints are reachable by your proxies or add them to the `no-proxy` section. Depending on your environment configuration, this may include, but is not limited to, your OIDC or LDAP server, Harbor, NSX-T, NSX Advanced Load Balancer.

        ![Kubernetes Network page for management cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/44-Mgmt-cluster-9.png)

1. (Optional) Specify identity management with OIDC or LDAP. For this deployment, identity management is not enabled.

    If you would like to enable identity management, see [Enable and Configure Identity Management During Management Cluster Deployment](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/2.1/tkg-deploy-mc-21/mgmt-index.html).

    ![Identity management for management cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/45-Mgmt-cluster-10.png)  

1. Select the OS image to use for deploying the management cluster

    **Note:** This list appears empty if you don’t have a compatible template present in your environment. See the steps provided in [Import Base Image Template into vSphere](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/2.1/tkg-deploy-mc-21/mgmt-reqs-prep-vsphere.html).

    ![OS image for management cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/46-Mgmt-cluster-11.png)

1. Check the “Participate in the Customer Experience Improvement Program”, if you so desire, and click **Review Configuration**.

    **Note**: Tanzu Kubernetes Grid v2.1.0 has a known issue that installer UI populates an empty `NSXALB_LABEL` in the cluster configuration and leads to management cluster creation failure. It is recommended to export the cluster configuration to a file, delete the empty label, and run the cluster creation command from CLI instead of deploying the cluster from UI.

1. When you click on **Review Configuration**, the installer populates the cluster configuration file, which is located in the `~/.config/tanzu/tkg/clusterconfigs` subdirectory, with the settings that you specified in the interface. You can optionally export a copy of this configuration file by clicking **Export Configuration**.

    ![Deployment logs in installer UI](img/tko-on-vsphere/46-Mgmt-cluster-export.png)


1. Click **Deploy the Management cluster** 


    While the cluster is being deployed, you will find that a virtual service is created in NSX Advanced Load Balancer and new service engines are deployed in vCenter by NSX Advanced Load Balancer and the service engines are mapped to the SE Group `sfo01m01segroup01`.​​

When Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster is being deployed, behind the scenes:  

* NSX Advanced Load Balancer service engines get deployed in vCenter and this task is orchestrated by the NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller.
* Service engine status in NSX Advanced Load Balancer: The following snippet shows the service engines status. They are in the initializing state for sometime and then the status changes to Up.

    ![Service engine status](img/tko-on-vsphere/48-Mgmt-cluster-11.png)

* Service engine group status in NSX Advanced Load Balancer: As per the configuration, the virtual service required for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid clusters control plane HA are hosted on service engine group `sfo01m01segroup01`.  

    ![Service engine group status](img/tko-on-vsphere/50-Mgmt-cluster-15.png)

* Virtual service status in NSX Advanced Load Balancer: The cluster is configured with Production type that deployed 3 control plane nodes, which are placed behind the cluster VIP.

    ![Virtual service status dashboard](img/tko-on-vsphere/51-Mgmt-cluster-16.png)

    ![Virtual service status](img/tko-on-vsphere/52-Mgmt-cluster-17.png)

* The installer automatically sets the context to the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster on the bootstrap machine. Now you can access the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster from the bootstrap machine and perform additional tasks such as verifying the management cluster health and deploying the workload clusters, etc.

    To get the status of Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster, run the following command:

    ```
    tanzu management-cluster get
    ```

    ![Management cluster status CLI output](img/tko-on-vsphere/54-Mgmt-cluster-19.png)

   Use `kubectl` to get the status of the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster nodes.

## <a id="register-tmc"> </a> Register Management Cluster with Tanzu Mission Control

 If you want to register your management cluster with Tanzu Mission Control, see [Register Your Management Cluster with Tanzu Mission Control](./tko-saas-services.md#a-idtmc-a-tanzu-mission-control).

## <a id="workloadalb"> </a> Configure AKO Deployment Config (ADC) for Workload Clusters

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid v2.1.0 management clusters with NSX Advanced Load Balancer are deployed with 2 AKODeploymentConfigs.

* `install-ako-for-management-cluster`: default configuration for management cluster
* `install-ako-for-all`:  default configuration for all workload clusters. By default, all the workload clusters reference this file for their virtual IP networks and service engine (SE) groups. This ADC configuration does not enable NSX L7 Ingress by default.

As per this Tanzu deployment, create 2 more ADCs:

* `tanzu-ako-for-shared`: Used by shared services cluster to deploy the virtual services in `TKG Mgmt SE Group` and  the loadbalancer applications in `TKG Management VIP Network`.

* `tanzu-ako-for-workload-L7-ingress`: Use this ADC only if you would like to enable NSX Advanced Load Balancer L7 ingress on workload cluster. Otherwise, leave the cluster labels empty to apply the network configuration from default ADC `install-ako-for-all`.

### <a id="sharedako"> </a> Configure AKODeploymentConfig (ADC) for Shared Services Cluster

As per the defined architecture, shared services cluster uses the same control plane and data plane network as the management cluster. Shared services cluster control plane endpoint uses `TKG Cluster VIP Network`, application loadbalancing uses `TKG Management Data VIP network` and the virtual services are deployed in `sfo01m01segroup01` SE group. This configuration is enforced by creating a custom AKO Deployment Config (ADC) and applying the respective `NSXALB_LABELS` while deploying the shared services cluster.

The format of the AKODeploymentConfig YAML file is as follows.

### <a id="l7workloadako"> </a> Configure AKO Deployment Config (ADC) for Workload Cluster to Enable NSX ALB L7 Ingress with NodePortLocal Mode

VMware recommends using NSX Advanced Load Balancer L7 ingress with NodePortLocal mode for the L7 application load balancing. This is enabled by creating a custom ADC with ingress settings enabled, and then applying the NSX_ALB LABEL while deploying the workload cluster.  

As per the defined architecture, workload cluster cluster control plane endpoint uses `TKG Cluster VIP Network`, application loadbalancing uses `TKG Workload Data VIP network` and the virtual services are deployed in `sfo01w01segroup01` SE group. 

Below are the changes in ADC Ingress section when compare to the default ADC. 

* **disableIngressClass**: set to `false` to enable NSX ALB L7 Ingress.

* **nodeNetworkList**: Provide the values for TKG workload network name and CIDR.

* **serviceType**:  L7 Ingress type, recommended to use `NodePortLocal`

* **shardVSSize**: Virtual service size

The format of the AKODeploymentConfig YAML file for enabling NSX ALB L7 Ingress is as follows.

Now that you have successfully created the AKO deployment config, you need to apply the cluster labels while deploying the workload clusters to enable NSX Advanced Load Balancer L7 Ingress with NodePortLocal mode.

## <a id="dep-shared-cluster"> </a> Deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Shared Services Cluster  

Each Tanzu Kubernetes Grid instance can have only one shared services cluster. Create a shared services cluster if you intend to deploy Harbor.  

The procedures for deploying a shared services cluster and workload cluster are almost the same. A key difference is that for the shared service cluster you add the `tanzu-services` label to the shared services cluster, as its cluster role. This label identifies the shared services cluster to the management cluster and workload clusters.  

Shared services cluster uses the custom ADC `tanzu-ako-for-shared` created earlier to apply the network settings similar to the management cluster. This is enforced by applying the NSXALB_LABEL `type:shared-services` while deploying the shared services cluster.

After the management cluster is registered with Tanzu Mission Control, the deployment of the Tanzu Kubernetes clusters can be done in just a few clicks. The procedure for creating Tanzu Kubernetes clusters is as follows. <p>     **Note:** The scope of this document doesn't cover the use of a proxy for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid deployment. If your environment uses a proxy server to connect to the internet, ensure that the proxy configuration object includes the CIDRs for the pod, ingress, and egress from the workload network of the Management Cluster in the **No proxy list**, as described in [Create a Proxy Configuration Object for a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service Cluster Running in vSphere with Tanzu](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Mission-Control/services/tanzumc-using/GUID-B4760775-388A-45B5-A707-2191E9E4F41F.html).

1. Navigate to the Clusters tab and click **Create Cluster** and select **Create Tanzu Kubernetes Grid cluster**.

1. Under the Create cluster page, select the management cluster which you registered in the previous step and click **Continue to create cluster**.

    ![Select management cluster for shared services cluster ](img/tko-on-vsphere/65-shared-service-1.png)

1. Select the provisioner for creating the shared services cluster. Provisioner reflects the vSphere namespaces that you have created and associated with the management cluster.

    ![Select provisioner for shared services cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/66-shared-service-2.png)

1. On the **Cluster Details** page, do the following: 
- Enter a name for the cluster (Cluster names must be unique within an organization).
- Select the cluster group to which you want to attach your cluster.
- Select Cluster Class from the drop down.
- Use the NSXALB_Labels created for shared cluster on AKO Deployment.

    ![Cluster name and cluster group](img/tko-on-vsphere/67-shared-service-3.png)

5. On the **Configure** page, specify the following:

   - In the **vCenter** and **tlsThumbprint** fields, enter the details for authentication.
   - From the  **datacenter**, **resourcePool**, **folder**, **network**, and **datastore** drop down, select the required information.
   - From the **template** drop down, select the Kubernetes version.The latest supported version is preselected for you. 
   - In the **sshAuthorizedKeys** field, enter the SSH key that was created earlier.
   - Enable aviAPIServerHAProvider.

    ![Kubernetes version, network and storage options](img/tko-on-vsphere/68-shared-service-4.png)

1. Update POD CIDR and Service CIDR if necessary.

    ![Resources backing the cluster](img/tko-on-vsphere/69-shared-service-5.png)

1. Select the high availability mode for the control plane nodes of the shared services cluster. For a production deployment, it is recommended to deploy a highly available shared services cluster.

    ![Select between single node and HA mode for control plane](img/tko-on-vsphere/70-shared-service-6.png)

1. Customize the default node pool for your workload cluster.

    * Specify the number of worker nodes to provision.
    * Select OS Version.

1. Click **Create Cluster** to start provisioning your workload cluster.

1. 
    Cluster creation takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. After the cluster deployment completes, ensure that agent and extensions health shows green.

    ![Agent and extensions health status](img/tko-on-vsphere/73-shared-service-9.png)

Now that the shared services cluster is successfully created, you may proceed with deploying the Harbor package. For more information, see Install Harbor in [Deploy User-Managed Packages in Workload Clusters](./tkg-package-install.md).

1. Connect to the Tanzu Management Cluster context and verify the cluster labels for the workload cluster.
